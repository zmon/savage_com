		<description><![CDATA[Excellent question! 
Debbie and I have been inundated by barriers to keeping the pace, e.g. Deb &#039;s being the primary person managing her mother, who is at late stages of Alzheimer&#039;s disease. Maybe we should write some posts on that. The research out there shows that caretakers of people with Alzheimer&#039;s take a real blast at their immune system, and it goes on long after the the patient dies.

In my case, it is harder to come up with new ideas when you have been writing them for so long. I do extensive reviews of the material after the blog post has been written, and many edits bounced back and forth between the two of us.

Finally we were hit by a problem that made us unable to log on to our site and I spent over a month working with our provider to find a solution. After climbing up abut six levels to the peak of tech support at our provider, they had no useful answers. So I had to find work-a rounds. So farbtheynare all cumbersome and slow.

That&#039;s probably more than you were asking for, but it&#039;s actually abbreviated.

It has provided incentives for keeping up with our own resilience practices. We have to keep that in mind.
