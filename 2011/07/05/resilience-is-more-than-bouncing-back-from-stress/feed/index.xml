		<description><![CDATA[It is interesting. I think when younger I was compelled to succeed in spite of the &quot;poor hand&quot; dealt me.   That was success in work, school and building a home that my children could be proud of.  However, I think that was only outward resilience and a &#039;good life&#039; in the sense that everyone would see that in spite of the difficult beginnings I was able to create success in my life.  

However, now I think of resilience quite differently in terms of inward resilience and being able to identify and live with good people who contribute to an inner good life, better known as happiness.  I am a much happier person now and that feels much more like true resilience than a successful outer life ever did.

Do the studies on resilience differentiate between inner &#038; out life resilience?]]></description>
