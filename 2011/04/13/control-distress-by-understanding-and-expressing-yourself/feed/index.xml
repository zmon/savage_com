		<description><![CDATA[Writing down the feelings, problems or whatever in your mind and the all the thoughts in mind helps to overcome the distress. At later time , you can read the writing and sometimes can find certain answers to the problem that you are having. 
But it is vital to keep the writing safely away from others who you don&#039;t believe that they will not listen or sympathize or help you to overcome the matter. Because what you write down is highly private.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I agree with this from experience in working with others and in working in a hospital environment.  I think nurses, doctors and staff need short debriefing to take place, either formally or non-formally after traumatic events or when there is an intense near life &#038; death situation.  Some hospitals do this formally and others do not.   It&#039;s interesting that an informal way of taking care of this need works as well as a formal debriefing, OR does it?]]></description>
