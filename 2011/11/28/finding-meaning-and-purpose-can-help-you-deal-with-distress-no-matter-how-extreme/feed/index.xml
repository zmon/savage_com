		<description><![CDATA[I heard once that meaninglessness comes not from having too much pain, but too much pleasure. No one has grown outside of adversity. Tough to accept but true. Those with a lot of &quot;scar tissue&quot;- healed wounds of pain, are the ones with the wisdom I seek. Thank you for the reminder and encouragement to seek after meaning. It digs our pylons deep in the soil of life.
