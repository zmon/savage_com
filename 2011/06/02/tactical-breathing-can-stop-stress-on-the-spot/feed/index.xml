		<description><![CDATA[Can you get an audio set up to guide you through the breathing method with the correct? I have used audios many times for myself, and also have tried using audios in presenting resilience training programs. The audios seem to work as well as having someone present to guide the procedure.

Congratulations for being gritty enough to use the powers of your mind to find a way to greater functional capability.

		<description><![CDATA[Jerry,
I have suffered from a  stroke and can not remember to keep the five steps in order.
I can remember to do your two step process of inhale to 4 count and exhale to 7 count .

		<description><![CDATA[These techniques absolutely work. I learned them from my divorce lawyer to deal with the stress of depositions and trial. My wife learned these from her doctor help slow down or stop panic attacks. My son is learning these to help calm himself down.

A cooler head, a more focused mind almost always wins.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Nice tip with the word relax - it is easy to forget that relaxation is something we must consciously aim at, and keep reminding ourselves to pursue, rather than something that happens by default. 

Good blog, added to my favourites now.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I have anxiety &#038; panic disorder as well as PTSD! It has been &#038; can be very debilitating effecting every aspect of my life. 
What I really like about what you are saying is RELAXXXXX. Wow, I guess I needed to hear that but more importantly it is for me from this day forward has gone into my mental tool kit so that Tactical Breathing with the word Relaxxxx becomes a part of my everyday life in any situation. 
I&#039;ve actually paid for classes on how to deal with these disorders but never did anyone touch base on the word relaxxx. Your way of describing the breathing is also very affective with the word Relaxxx because for me the two go hand in hand, one cannot be done with the other.. I have read other articles about this but found your methods so much simpler that it immediately clicked with my brain and the all my mental lights began to process this so quickly. This technique is part of me in my everyday life...
Thank You so very much, who would&#039;ve thought that one word makes all the different in the world...]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I have emphysema and often find myself running out of air which can cause a panic state. I heard a young man in a seal team video discussing combat breathing and thought it might help me with my breathlessness. I have found combat breathing prior to and during activity aids me in keeping ahead of the O2sat curve. I practice it in the morning before getting up and before taking my inhalers.
Prior to this blog I had not heard mention of mentally saying relax....but I have incorporated it into my routine. Thank you]]></description>
