		<description><![CDATA[This article reminds me of why I went to grad school &#038; studied psychology.  I was working as a nurse in a Surgical Intensive Care Unit and observed that simple things made a huge difference in a person getting off of a ventilator (a machine that breathes for a person).   When the doctors asked what I did to facillitate the patient getting off the ventilator I told them that I did simple things like explain what each sound was they were hearing, what the process of getting off a ventilator would feel like, I held their hand while I was in the room when I could, I made sure they were tucked in so that there were not drafts from under the sheets or blankets, and I gave them a pen &#038; paper to write with giving them a way to communicate since they could not talk.  

I made sure the room was free of clutter so that it would have a peaceful feel rather than a chaotic feel to it.  I myself was amazed at how much difference it made in such a high tech world.   I never lost a patient in the ICU, I never once had a patient code in the ICU, and they all got better, even those not expected to live.]]></description>
