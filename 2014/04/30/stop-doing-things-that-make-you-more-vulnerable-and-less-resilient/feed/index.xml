		<description><![CDATA[Well, &quot;turning it up to eleven&quot; may not yield the expected result.

http://www.the-scientist.com//?articles.view/articleNo/39734/title/Triggering-Resilience-to-Depression/

Saw this, thought it fit well with the things you have blogged.  

I learned about that “Chinese saying” they mention when I studied Karate, with a primer on the basics of Traditional Chinese Medicine.  It’s more nuanced than the linked article make it sound.  I learned the concept as the phrase, “Too much yin is yang.”  In the context I learned it the suggestion was more like “moderation in all things.”  The idea my teachers conveyed was indeed that extremes yield unexpected results, our systems are not linear.  The saying as I learned it does convey the idea that you can “tip something completely over” and back around to a beginning, but that’s because there’s an understanding that everything in the body system is a sort of loop.

I read this article and feel concern for the average reader to oversimplify the finding.  I can just see the potential for ordinary folks to rush to a (still-linear) model of: “Oh!  That means &#039;If some’s good, more’s better!&#039; ” The idea begs misdirection, and a small voice inside me rushes to say “Wait, no, it’s not LIKE that!”
