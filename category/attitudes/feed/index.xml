				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When we discussed the Sense of Coherence in our previous post, we said that it was a match for the first factor in our three factor model of resilience.</p>
<p>In both popular culture (e.g. Rev. Normal Vincent Peale’s “The Power of Positive Thinking” which had a huge impact in the United States and elsewhere) and scientifically developed theory (e.g. Barbara Frederickson’s book, “Positivity”), the value of positivity has been recognized as playing a major role in lives well-lived.</p>
<p>But we see a distinction between attitudes of positivity and positive skills that are closely connected to those attitudes.</p>
<p>Probably most people would predict that positive attitudes and thoughts are related to resilience. But having skills such as knowing ways to calm and soothe yourself when distressed have been given less attention. In addition, many of us possess the needed skills, but do not implement them.</p>
<p>Once we take the skills to the point where we actually implement them when they are needed, we have reached the third level of using resilience tools, the level of habit.</p>
<p>In sum, we have to go from attitudes to skills and on to habits.</p>
<p>Isn’t this a lot of work? It can be, but for the most part the process is very enjoyable, even exhilarating at times.</p>
<p>Do we need to say that we think you should give it a try?</p>
<p>If you decide to do that, <a href="/2014/12/22/prepare-for-your-later-life-by-accumulating-skills-and-habits-of-resilience/">this</a> and <a href="/2014/10/08/build-your-toughness-and-become-more-resilient/">this</a> will help get you started.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Underlying our posts is a three-factor model of resilience which was derived from research done as part of my role as a professor. Our posts tend to be on specific attitudes or actions that are statistically confirmed aspects of one of the three factors. That is not because we select them only if they match our model. Our model just matches the data.</p>
<p>The blog was not started to publicize or support the model. It started as an outlet to keep me from constantly adding new findings to a book Debbie and I wrote to teach people how to improve their resilience.</p>
<p>To identify the core factors that underlie resilience we used a method called factor analysis. Done correctly, it can reveal the deep structure of whatever you are studying. So, for example, if you used it on three dimensional objects, like boxes, it would tell you that there are three dimensions, height, width and length.</p>
<p>We determined the dimensions of resilience and found that there were three. We also replicated that finding in two additional studies, and both of them confirmed the three dimensions.</p>
<p>To explain the factors here would be redundant, since we have already done that in <a href="/2011/01/11/the-three-core-factors-that-can-make-you-more-resilient/">this post</a>.</p>
<p>For now, we will discuss the number one factor that improves resilience.</p>
<h2>What good is this to you?</h2>
<p>Knowing the core dimensions will help you pinpoint all you can do to improve your resilience.</p>
<p>The number one influence on resilience is developing resilience-promoting  <strong><em>attitudes</em></strong> and <strong><em>skills</em></strong>.  These account for so much of resilience that, for a while, I was tempted to think of Factor One alone as just plain resilience, and ignore the other two factors. But too much evidence showed that those factors can be crucial for many people.</p>
<p>So what are the attitudes and skills you should try to develop?</p>
<p><span id="more-1392"></span></p>
<ul>
<li>Being optimistic and hopeful instead of pessimistic and hopeless.</li>
<li>Seeing distressing or painful life events as problems to be solved instead of things to be lamented and cursed.</li>
<li>Looking for and maybe even finding meaning in what we do and what we experience instead of just slogging through life.</li>
<li>Learning how to sooth, calm and replenish yourself, and then <strong><em>applying what you have learned </em></strong>to your everyday life when you are distressed, and also when you are feeling okay. (The latter is important in order to develop <strong><em>habits</em></strong> of resilience.).</li>
</ul>
<p>Some of the attitudes under factor one that help us be more resilient are</p>
<ol start="1">
<li>Being optimistic and hopeful versus viewing life with pessimism or despair.</li>
</ol>
<p>Here are posts that tell you how to do that:</p>
<p><a href="/2011/01/01/less-pessimism-and-more-optimism-will-build-your-resilience/">Increasing your optimism.</a></p>
<p><a href="/2012/08/02/reducing-negativity-in-your-mind-and-your-life/">Decreasing your negativity.</a></p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Viewing our lives, our choices, and our actions as meaningful versus seeing them as meaningless.</li>
</ol>
<p>Here is a post to help you do that.</p>
<p><a href="/2011/11/28/finding-meaning-and-purpose-can-help-you-deal-with-distress-no-matter-how-extreme/">Finding  meaning.</a></p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Taking a problem-solving attitude toward stressful situations and anticipating predictable complications.</li>
</ol>
<p>Here is a post that shows you how to do that:</p>
<p><a href="/2012/08/02/reducing-negativity-in-your-mind-and-your-life/">Problem-Solving Attitude.</a></p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Learning and applying  the skills that sooth and replenish you instead of taking actions that make things worse.</li>
</ol>
<p>There are many posts that show how to do that:</p>
<p><a href="/2011/03/02/basic-mindfulness-technique/">Training yourself in mindfulness.</a></p>
<p><a href="/2011/06/02/tactical-breathing-can-stop-stress-on-the-spot/">Breath control for resilience.</a></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>To improve our positivity/negativity ratio, positives have to increase and negatives have to decrease. Fortunately, a limitation inherent in our brains leads to an automatic reduction of negatives as we increase our positives.</p>
<p>Our brains have enormous capacity for memory, and it’s not easy for even the most powerful computers to do better than us. But, at any moment in time, we can process only a very small amount of information.</p>
<p>The more we load our minds with positive experiences, the less room there will be for negatives.</p>
<p>Still that is not likely to be enough; we also need to target our negative thoughts and experiences directly.</p>
<p>In several previous posts we have talked about how to deal with negative thinking, especially self-criticism. Those posts <a href="/2011/02/20/to-increase-your-resilience-avoid-being-too-hard-on-yourself/">1</a>, <a href="/2011/03/02/basic-mindfulness-technique/">2</a>, <a href="/2012/01/03/from-negative-thinking-and-self-criticism-to-positive-thinking-and-self-compassion/?#more-891">3</a>, <a href="/2012/02/16/depressed-anxious-being-hard-on-yourself-new-insights-about-the-value-of-learning-to-be-both-self-compassionate-and-self-soothing/">4</a>, are a good guide to dealing with our negative thoughts.</p>
<p>But improving our patterns of thought is not the same as improving our life situation. That requires coming up with a path that will lead to more positive experiences.</p>
<p>We have to take a number of steps to find and walk such a path. An obvious step is <em>finding</em> the path, but we also need to develop a plan of action, be assertive, etc. Taking a problem solving attitude is a pervasive influence on helping us through those steps.</p>
<p>Having a problem-solving attitude toward reducing the impact of negative experiences is an important component of resilience.</p>
<p><span id="more-1114"></span></p>
<p>A problem-solving attitude isn’t necessarily about having high skills at problem-solving (though that is probably also very important). It is about believing that there is a good enough chance of finding a solution to make it worth searching for one, and it is closely related to hope, optimism, and perseverance.</p>
<p>When we discuss making like changes, many people react in a knee-jerk way with ideas like “This can never change!”, “There is no solution”, “People can’t really change”.</p>
<p>I could write a book about how wrong those attitudes are; it is virtually impossible to know that something cannot be done. People used to believe that things heavier than air could not fly. Then came the Wright brothers’ 1903 flight at Kitty Hawk, North Carolina.</p>
<p>Now we have many ways to fly- jet planes, rockets, gliders that individuals can wear and fly off a cliff, helicopters, and even bicycle-based airplanes.</p>
<p>Usually after people finally solve a hard problem, you can ask them to think of several more ways to solve it, and they can do that too. Running a four-minute mile was once thought to be impossible. Then, once Roger Bannister succeeded at running one, four-minute miles became almost common.</p>
<p>I think the right attitude toward problems is to assume that there are <em>many</em> solutions out there, waiting to be recognized. Our task is to look for at least one of them.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Studies of holocaust survivors indicate that<em> how we react</em> is, even in extreme circumstances, crucial in determining how much damage is done. Though we have little or no control over outside circumstances, we can still influence our inner reactions to them.</p>
<p>Today, many people face exceptionally harsh conditions, and they are unaccustomed to the levels of stress they have to endure. It is hard for them to believe there is anything they can do to make things better. The problem is outside of them and beyond their control. How they react to their circumstances may seem irrelevant.</p>
<p>But research on holocaust survivors indicates that how one reacts even in the most heinous situations has a powerful effect on survival and well-being.</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salutogenesis" target="_self">Aaron Antonovsky </a>studied survivors of the camps, and concluded that, though they were largely helpless on the outside, their inner attitudes could make a great difference. Prior to that work, Victor Frankl, a survivor of the camps, had written about his own views on this topic from an inside perspective. He and Antonovsky came to very similar conclusions about which ways of reacting were best.</p>
<p><span id="more-865"></span></p>
<p>Frankl wrote an outstanding book called “<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Mans-Search-Meaning-Viktor-Frankl/dp/0671023373">Man’s Search for Meaning</a>” about how he dealt with the concentration camp experience.  To him the key was finding meaning and purpose. This might seem impossible in a situation so horrific, but he found meaning there in two ways.</p>
<ul>
<li>He was a medical doctor      able to help others in the camp, and that gave meaning to his painful      life. He even chose not to take a chance to escape because he, as a      doctor, could help others survive.</li>
<li>He also found meaning in      refusing to cooperate with the attempts that were made to force him to behave      in ways that were meant to degrade his full humanity, which was one of the      goals of his captors (See the movie Sophie&#8217;s Choice).</li>
</ul>
<p>Frankl lived a rich life till the age of 92.</p>
<p>Here is an old, black and white <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wr6itOBLVQA">video</a> of Frankl, at the age of 72 advising us how to treat others in a way that can help them realize their full potential as human beings, and also how to set goals for ourselves.</p>
<p>The video is worth viewing just to see how alive and passionate a person can be despite having lived through hell.</p>
<p>For both Frankl and Antonovsky, finding meaning and purpose was of central importance. It is also an important facet of the resilience model we derived from statistical analyses of resilience factors.</p>
<p>The first and most important factor included being realistically optimistic, having a problem-solving attitude toward difficult situations, and finding meaning and value in what you choose to do.</p>
<p>Fortunately there are tested ways to coach yourself to develop these qualities. That is what this blog is all about.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Some people seem to be just naturally optimistic. I have been lucky to have some close friends who are like that. Optimism seems to be a natural part of their personalities. I have learned from them.</p>
<p>My own family tended to be what President Reagan used to call “doomers and gloomers”.  But that was only a tendency. We were always inclined to believe that our efforts could change things for the better. Like us, most people are a mix of optimist and pessimist.</p>
<p>My experience and my reading of the scientific research on optimism versus pessimism has convinced me that <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Positivity-Groundbreaking-Research-Strength-Negativity/dp/0307393739">it is a good idea for most of us to be less pessimistic and more optimistic</a>. Especially to be less pessimistic, but more optimistic is good too. It’s really more than a good idea; it can have a major impact on your happiness, health, and success.</p>
<p>The important question is how do we change in the direction of optimism?</p>
<p>There is a lot of published research on this, and it is encouraging. Here is our take on the most promising ways to become less pessimistic and more optimistic.</p>
<ul>
<li>Direct your attention to things that have gone well for you.</li>
<li>When you interpret things in ways that discourage you, seriously consider other, more positive ways to interpret what happened.</li>
<li>When pessimistic thoughts come to mind, view them with suspicion and strongly challenge them.</li>
<li>When your efforts produce bad results, be wary if you attribute the results to causes that are very difficult or even impossible to change.</li>
</ul>
<p>Changing these aspects of how you deploy your mind is not easy. The way you do it now is probably based on powerful motivations and long experience. So we have to consider <em>how</em> to change mental patterns that are deeply ingrained. We will do that in our next post.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3><em>Highlights:</em></h3>
<p><em>Optimism is about looking at reality and attending more to a positive interpretation of it than to a negative one. Thinking that “The glass is half full” rather than “The glass is half empty” is almost a paradigm of optimism. The true state of the glass is not in dispute. Anyone who looks at it can see where the waterline is. The issue is which aspect of that line gets more attention.</em></p>
<p><em>*****************************************</em></p>
<p>I am a longstanding  <a href="http://www.barbaraehrenreich.com/">Barbara Ehrenreich</a> fan. So when I learned that she had written a book blaming positive thinking for undermining America, I was taken aback. I had just finished co-authoring a book that included a section on the positive impact of optimism. Research strongly affirms the benefits of optimism for such things as health, performance, and success. Of course the term “positive thinking” is very loosely defined, but presumably optimism would be somewhere near its core meaning.</p>
<p>Fortunately I had two background experiences that helped me understand why someone would be cynical about the impact of optimism. My reading on the topic included works about the impact of optimism on business performance. There too, I encountered a very pessimistic view of optimism. There was even a paper critical of optimism co-authored by Nobel Prize winner, <a href="http://hbswk.hbs.edu/archive/3630.html">Daniel Kahneman</a>, whose work I have followed with admiration for decades.</p>
<p>Looking at the arguments closely, I found that the business writers were using the word “optimism” as an equivalent of what psychologists call “denial”. A business person failing to include some significant aspect of reality that is relevant to his or her business decisions is in denial. These critical accounts of optimism refer to such things as failing to take into account the downside risks of business decisions. But that is not what I or many other people are talking about when we refer to optimism.</p>
<p>Optimism is about<em> looking at reality</em> and attending more to a positive interpretation of it than to a negative one. Thinking that “The glass is half full” rather than “The glass is half empty” is almost a paradigm of optimism. The true state of the glass is not in dispute. Anyone who looks at it can see where the waterline is. The issue is which aspect of that line gets more attention.<span id="more-502"></span></p>
<p>Another past experience of mine prepared me for the even more dour view of optimism that Barbara Ehrenreich is espousing. I had been clinical director of the cancer support center funded by the late Richard Bloch at the University of Missouri-Kansas City. Often patients coming to the Center had previously been told that they must not allow themselves to have negative thoughts. Research literature, if anything, indicates some positive effects of talking out or writing about how you feel when distressed.</p>
<p>Dodging negative thoughts and distressed feelings is not likely to enhance health.</p>
<p>As we point out in our book, talking out feelings must be distinguished from venting, or what many of our patients dealing with cancer called “bitching sessions”. These sessions did not get people anywhere, and actually pulled people down.Venting tends to trap people in unproductive lamenting. It is best to clarify how you feel about what has happened and to use your deepened understanding productively.</p>
<p>Another aspect of the case Ehrenreich  makes against positive thinking is that many patients had been led to believe that their thoughts could change reality without any action on their part. Many people coping with cancer conclude from this that they are at fault for bringing the cancer on themselves because of their habits of thought.</p>
<p>The idea that we can cure cancer merely by changing our thoughts from negative to positive was regularly pushed on Barbara Ehrenreich as she dealt with her own breast cancer. But that is not optimism. It is fantasy. As I said earlier, there is an abundance of evidence that optimism has positive effects on many aspects of life, including health. Fantasy, on the other hand, has been categorized as an “immature” defense mechanism, and defenses of that kind do not tend to result in healthy, happy lives. (For more on this topic, see the account of Vaillant’s categorization of defense mechanisms <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defence_mechanism">here</a>.</p>
<p>I hope it is clear that I am not dismissing the role of psychological factors in dealing with cancer. Well-designed research shows that both quality of life and survival rates can be improved by psychological means. Ehrenreich seems to have missed the well-controlled studies that have been published on this topic. (To see, for example, recent work of Barbara Andersen and colleagues, click <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2661422/">here</a>. Copies of this and other work of Andersen can be downloaded <a href="http://stressandimmunity.osu.edu/11446.cfm">here</a>.</p>
<p>I may have more to say about Ehrenreich’s book later, but I do not want to turn this post into a book review, and I need to move on.</p>
