				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In this post we take a look at ways people manage to live at the outer limits of survivable stress without totally breaking down.</p>
<p>Our rationale? If the methods have worked in the nastiest even potentially fatal settings, there is a good chance that some version of them will help most of us.</p>
<p>A look at the lives of people who have lived through an ultra-stressful period of their lives quickly reveals that there are striking differences in how well people handle intense, and even deadly stress.</p>
<p>For decades there seemed to be no way to tell who would survive such lethal environments and who would not.</p>
<p>Anne Applebaum has a deep knowledge of one such environment, the brutal Soviet “Gulag” prison camps.</p>
<p>Her profound study of the Gulags failed to provide her with any formula for predicting who might survive them. This passage illustrates her views:</p>
<p>“… almost everyone who lived through the experiences of the Gulag agrees that survival was impossible to predict in advance. The mildest people sometimes found an inner strength they had not known of before. The bravest sometimes could not accept the daily humiliation, and died quickly. The strongest sometimes suffered the most from the lack of food. The weakest sometimes survived because no one bothered to torment them. In the end, the very quirkiness of human nature defies even the most drastic attempts to predict or control it. It is hardly surprising, then, that it is difficult to predict as well.&#8221; Applebaum (2003).</p>
<p>Findings from controlled research on ultra-stressful environments also left the investigators baffled about what might enable people to deal with those situations.</p>
<p>One striking study done under the auspices of the U.S. Navy, “Project Sealab II”, was designed to identify qualities in people that helped them get through the experience of living deep under the ocean in a crowded, uncomfortable, often frustrating environment. Sealab largely disconnected them from the outside world and had settled at an angle that produced many problems, including impaired sleep. In addition, it was life-threatening because mistakes at the depths of the ocean could quickly result in death for oneself and others.</p>
<p>Before participants were transferred to Sealab, they were given an extensive array of psychological tests. Surely some of the tests would predict who would be resilient enough to excel in dealing with the challenges.</p>
<p>However, it is easy to summarize the results of this study: Consistent with Applebaum’s account of the unpredictable reactions to the Gulags, none of the psychological tests distinguished between who would do well and who would be overwhelmed.</p>
<p>There was one outstanding dissenter about whether breakdown and even death is likely to occur in the horrible settings we have been discussing. Victor Frankl, a Professor of Neurology and Psychiatry at the University of Vienna Medical School was, when the Nazis took over Austria, sent to a sequence of concentration camps. Well known ones were Auschwitz and Dachau. He wrote a number of books about his experiences in the camps and his analysis of people’s reaction.</p>
<p>He concluded that maintaining a sense of meaning, purpose, and hope was central to surviving. Some people would lose those qualities, and then die quickly.</p>
<p><span id="more-1976"></span></p>
<p>In his best known book, which was titled “Man’s Search for Meaning” he described a prisoner who had a vivid dream in which he was told that he could have one wish. He wished that the suffering would end by a specified date. The dream had seemed so real, and had touched him so deeply that he believed his wish would be granted. He did well until the specified date occurred and his wish was not granted.</p>
<p>After that day he swiftly declined and died.</p>
<p>Scientifically, this story would provide mere anecdotal evidence of the power of hope and of how lethal the loss of hope can be. In more recent time, systematic research has also confirmed the value of finding meaning, purpose, and hope.</p>
<p>Research published in the 1970s by an American-Israeli Medical Sociologist, Aaron Antonovsky, who had long studied survivors of the Nazi Holocaust discovered a pattern that did distinguish people who adapted most effectively. He found that people who did well had a set of attitudes he termed a “sense of coherence”.</p>
<p>What did he mean by “sense of coherence”? It corresponded very closely with Frankl’s view. People with this view of life tended to find meaning or purpose, even in this worst of environments. They also were able to find a way to live according to some purpose or purposes, and to find some way to make sense of the world they were living in, no matter how senseless that world might seem.</p>
<p>The model of resilience we have used for decades was based on statistical analyses of data that represented patterns of resilience, and they have consistently shown that the most important factor nicely reflects the views of Frankl and Antonovsky. We think of it as “positive attitudes and skills”, and it includes optimism and hope, but also an inclination to take a problem-solving attitude toward distressing circumstances.</p>
<p>Want to apply these ideas to your own life? Onresilience has many posts on how to do that. Try this one, and this one, for example.</p>
<p>With respect to finding purpose in your life, it often seems endless and a bit too “philosophical”. Victor Frankl offers an approach that makes this search easier. He points out that life confronts us with experiences that point out a purpose for us.</p>
<p>What does this mean? Suppose you have an elderly parent or grandparent living in your house, who falls down your long flight of stairs and breaks her hip? She is in extreme pain and crying for help. Your immediate purpose is to get her to medical care as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>From a resilience point of view, the key is to recognize that you are fulfilling a very meaningful purpose. You will have to problem solve to decide whether (before you know you are dealing with a broken hip) to move her or call for an ambulance. You pick the solution that you hope will provide her with the best outcome.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/12/give-smile">A recent article in the New Yorker</a> was written by Jonathan Kalb, who, after a period of unexplained, severe headache woke up unable to smile on one side of his face. His face on that side just drooped, though he seemed to have normal responses on the other side. He had experienced an attack of  “<a href="http://www.ninds.nih.gov/disorders/bells/detail_bells.htm#259373050">Bell’s Palsy</a>”</p>
<p>This kind of functional loss is particularly disturbing because it can distort the facial expression of emotions. Thus, it can impair the ability to interact with others.</p>
<p>In Kalb’s case, the problem was increased by his role as a journalist, whose job called for him to interact normally and to form a kind of bond with strangers.</p>
<p>Those symptoms could even influence his ability to maintain a normal relationship with his immediate family.</p>
<p>What if his wife had been put off by his distorted smile? What if his son was embarrassed by him?</p>
<p>You can see that he had plummeted into a threat to his normal family relationships as well as his job and his social interactions in general.</p>
<p>Yet, his article focuses not on his woes, but instead on how he continued his life despite the problem that had haphazardly come his way. In other words, it focuses on the tactics he used to respond with resilience.</p>
<p>All of us have, at times, faced blows that made our lives harder. So we have something in common with Mr. Kalb. We can learn to improve our own resilience by seeing how people with troubling challenges like his can respond successfully.</p>
<p>So what did he do?</p>
<p><span id="more-1843"></span></p>
<p>Kalb responded with an approach that suited his personality as well as with his life experience as one who gathered information. He applied something that must have been natural to him, a “problem-solving attitude”.</p>
<p>Our research has shown us that this attitude clusters with such things as hopefulness, optimism and persistence. Probably all of these contributed to the effective way in which he dealt with his problem.</p>
<p>To begin with, he learned as much as he could about the capacities he had lost and the ways in which others react to distortion of those capacities. One thing he learned was that people tend to be disturbed by the confusing mix of smile and frown that they might see on his face.</p>
<p>A frown is bad, but a confusing frown mixed with a smile is worse.</p>
<p>Fortunately, through his studies he also came to understand that, if others <strong><em>firs</em></strong>t saw parts of his face that signaled good will, this helped to control how they reacted when they saw the rest of his face later. This is the familiar power of first impressions. These early impressions tend to guide subsequent reactions by providing a template for them.</p>
<p>So at first he focused on limiting others’ view of his face to its functionally intact side.</p>
<p>His problem-solving attitude also led him to ask for help from his wife in keeping his frowning side away from others who were not yet acclimatized to his more welcoming side.</p>
<p>When going into social situations, he arranged for his wife to move to his “bad” side when he was meeting new people. Since this led him to look at her during his conversations, it prevented the new people from forming their first impressions based on looking at his impaired, frowning side, or a disorienting combination of the frowning and smiling sides.</p>
<p>Note that his wife’s help was crucial to his resilience. Resilience is not entirely internal to us as individuals. Other people are a crucial resource.</p>
<p>He even got help from his young son when he happened to be resting his chin on his hand in a way that led his son to say “Daddy, you just smiled!”  So he found out he had another way to keep the problematic facial expressions away and to start off with facial signals of warmth and positivity. He could just find inconspicuous ways to prop up the drooping side of his face.</p>
<p>You should read <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/12/give-smile">the original article</a> for more details of the tactics he used to keep him from losing his standing in the social world.</p>
<p>It seems very likely that, even in the full article, he is only discussing selected elements of his resilience tactics. He makes no mention of how he dealt with <strong><em>his emotional reactions</em></strong> to the symptoms. This has to have been a major part of his experience. It has to have been a frightening experience.</p>
<p>As regular readers of this blog will know, we identified <a href="/2011/01/11/the-three-core-factors-that-can-make-you-more-resilient/">three  different factors</a>  that underlie resilience. However, we are well aware that trying to build your resilience by changing too many of them at once is likely to overwhelm rather strengthen you.</p>
<p>Our view is that <a href="/2013/08/27/the-magic-of-small-changes/">small changes</a> can add up to result in large improvements.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In this post we hope to show you the value of a technique called “mental contrasting”. We want to explain that concept, to cite evidence that mental contrasting really helps people change their habits to healthier and more productive ones, and to tell you what you need to know in order to use it yourself.</p>
<p><span id="more-1785"></span></p>
<p>In an<a title="earlier post" href="/2010/12/06/getting-yourself-to-act-on-what-you-learn-about-building-resilience/"> earlier post </a>we discussed Gabrielle Oettingen’s method of “mental contrasting” as a way to keep yourself practicing resilience skills. If you want to build these skills and turn them into habits you have to practice. But it is hard to change habits, and we all have trouble getting ourselves to persist in habit-changing practices until we reach our goals.</p>
<p>Mental contrasting has a very credible basis to claim that it is an important technique to help us persist in needed practices.</p>
<p>An article written by Oettingen <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/26/opinion/sunday/the-problem-with-positive-thinking.html?_r=0">appeared in the October 24<sup>th</sup> New York Times</a>, and has been in our “to do” folder ever since. This week, we had a good opportunity to digest its content.</p>
<p>If you find a better summary of mental contrasting and its uses, please let us know. This one is excellent. It identifies research done on mental contrasting, showing that it helps “college students wanting a date, hip-replacement patients hoping to get back on their feet, graduate students looking for a job, (and) schoolchildren wishing to get good grades.” In addition, the study we cited earlier was on helping women lose weight. It helps.</p>
<p>So it’s clear that this is a technique that is both effective and widely applicable. It has helped people reach a variety of goals; in addition, the studies were done in both the United States and Germany. So the methods work in a variety of contexts.</p>
<p>The final test is: Do they work for you?</p>
<p>Would you like to try it for one of your goals? Here is Oettingen’s description of how to do that:</p>
<p>“…Think of a wish. For a few minutes, imagine the wish coming true, letting your mind wander and drift where it will. Then shift gears. Spend a few more minutes imagining the obstacles that stand in the way of realizing your wish.”</p>
<p>It’s as simple as that. If you try it, let us know how it works for you. We will share the results with a lot of other people.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Inevitably life confronts us with situations that are hard to handle. Sometimes our ability to handle them falls far short, and we are forced to go through a period in which we struggle and take some painful hits.</p>
<p>If we manage to get through such situations “in one piece”, we can be strengthened instead of being defeated.  When that happens, we have increased our resilience.</p>
<p>There are many different ways to come out on top of our struggles, or at least to keep them from utterly defeating us. If you take a quick trip through our 100+ posts in this blog, you will almost certainly find some that you can use as tools for getting through experiences you may encounter in the future.</p>
<p>A tool that has been occupying our attention lately is “Cognitive Reappraisal”.  It will be the central focus of this post.</p>
<p>What is cognitive reappraisal? It is a way to regulate our emotions. It calls on us to focus on finding alternative interpretations of what we are going through. This includes appraisals of the events that trigger our emotional reaction, the bodily responses that have been triggered, and of any other aspect of the total experience.</p>
<p><span id="more-1773"></span></p>
<p>To reappraise, we look for interpretations that shift us toward a more positive experience. For example, when having an experience that could be viewed as threatening we may have a hard time viewing it any other way. With reappraisal, we search for interpretations that help us see our situation as a challenge rather than a threat, and may even shift us from fear and hopelessness to excitement.</p>
<p>Cognitive reappraisal really works. Here are a few examples of its outcomes:</p>
<ul>
<li>It improves performance on difficult tasks, e.g. <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022103109002200">taking high stakes tests</a> that can determine access to a good career.</li>
<li>It can enable you to <a href="http://www.wjh.harvard.edu/~nock/nocklab/Jamieson-2013.pdf">use the energy and power of your physiological responses to stress</a> into positive ones that are linked to excitement rather than fear or rage.</li>
<li>It can increase your <a href="http://rmkaplan.bol.ucla.edu/Robert_M._Kaplan/1983_publications_files/0071.pdf">ability to endure painful situations</a>, e.g. a painful medical procedure.</li>
</ul>
<p>Notice that these examples cover a wide range of situations.  We have no reason to think that reappraisal applies only to a few specific circumstances.</p>
<h3><strong>What, Specifically Do We Reappraise?</strong></h3>
<p>We can reappraise our interpretation of the stressful <strong><em>event</em></strong>.</p>
<p>This involves looking for appraisals that are more encouraging, helpful, and supportive.</p>
<p>How do you find these new interpretations?</p>
<ol>
<li>Simply consider alternative interpretations of what has happened. Try to come up with a list of several alternative ones.</li>
</ol>
<p>Often we are very convinced that our first interpretation is the one and only realistic one. There is good evidence human judgments are often wrong. Our minds are subject to many cognitive biases. Furthermore, being certain about our judgments has little to do with how accurate they are.</p>
<p>This is worth a try: Imagine someone with a different personality who tends to be more positive than you and think about how that person might interpret what happened.</p>
<ol>
<li>Realize that you can “contain” your reactions to stress.</li>
</ol>
<p>Being in a stressful, scary situation need not mean that the only option you have is to escape from that situation. Many stage performers get intensely anxious before doing a performance. Some, even some of the greatest performers, vomit from the anxiety. Yet they step right out on the stage and wow the audience.</p>
<p>You can have intense feelings and urges to flee, then breathe deeply and do what the situation requires by allowing the feelings to be there, and observing them, but not letting them to take over control of what you do.</p>
<ol>
<li>You can reappraise the meaning of your physiological reactions to the stressful situation.</li>
</ol>
<p>e.g. The “fight or flight” response is <strong><em>adaptive.</em></strong> This means it can <strong><em>help you</em></strong> function well in difficult situations by sending the right chemicals to your organs that help your body perform at its highest levels. What you experience while under stress is an amalgam of the body’s reactions and the interpretations you add to them.</p>
<p><strong><em>Mastering the art of interpretation is the key to turning negative responses to stress into positive ones.</em></strong></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Having a “problem solving attitude” is an important influence on resilience. This attitude is a form of positivity, which is a well-known key to resilience. It is a facet of the <a href="/2011/01/11/the-three-core-factors-that-can-make-you-more-resilient/">first and most influential factor influencing resilience</a>. It is linked to “positivity”, which is a key to resilience.</p>
<p>What, exactly is a “problem-solving attitude”? The best way to explain this is to describe what people with this attitude are likely to believe about life’s challenges.</p>
<p>People with this kind of attitude tend to react to mistakes by trying to figure out how to avoid them in the future.</p>
<p>You might say, “Isn’t that what everybody does?”</p>
<p><span id="more-1667"></span></p>
<p>No! It is very common for people to spend much more time looking for who is to blame for what happened, and, in particular, trying to convince themselves and others that nothing they did contributed to the bad outcome. That results in learning nothing about how to make things better.</p>
<p>Are there steps you can take to improve your problem solving attitude?</p>
<p>One thing you should do when faced with difficult situations is mentally take a step back and review the nature of the problem. Too often people jump into active attempts to solve a problem without first reviewing the details of the situation that are giving rise to the problem.</p>
<p>A good example is how people react when their computer or mobile device will not respond the way it should. It is all too common to become frustrated and angry, maybe muttering expletives while quickly trying out various solutions without really thinking through what is likely to work. Muttering expletives doesn’t repair electronic equipment.</p>
<p>It’s best to settle down and think through the nature of the problem and then select a few potential solutions to try out. Then try them out, being sure to keep track of what you are trying and of the results.</p>
<p>Don’t start telling yourself how bad it will be if you fail to come up with a quick solution. The problem is likely to be less consequential than it seems when you are immersed in it. As Nobel Prize winning psychologist, Daniel Kahneman said “Nothing in life is as important as you think it is, while you are thinking about it”.</p>
<p>Emphasize that this is a <em>problem</em> to be <em>solved</em> and there may well be many solutions. Do not fall into the trap of thinking the problem simply cannot be solved.</p>
<p>Think of the centuries in which people insisted that it was impossible for humans to fly. Then the Wright brothers built their flying machine and then, over the next several years developed it into a stable way of flying. After that, many more ways of flying came to light.</p>
<p>One thing you should train yourself <strong><em>not </em></strong>to do is focus on criticizing yourself for making mistakes. If you do that, it is likely to engulf you, leaving little or no mental space for thinking about how to make things better. Attacking yourself is a matter of changing the subject from how to solve the problem to a mental discussion of your worth. At that point, you stop problem solving.</p>
<p>Avoid being one of the many people who actually <em>insist on hopelessness</em>. The last thing you should do is adopt any resilience-draining approach of quickly deciding that nothing can be done to improve results. That is the path of hopelessness.</p>
<p>You don’t have to be a baseball fan to appreciate the following story:</p>
<p>In his book “The Mental ABC’s of Pitching: A Handbook for Performance Enhancement”, Major League pitching coach and sports psychologist, Harvey Dorfman, provided a clarifying example of how easy it may be to succeed if you just focus your mind on looking for solutions.</p>
<p>He describes an encounter with a pitcher, Steve Mura, who had spent six seasons in the Major Leagues and won 12 games for the 1983 Cardinals He was the starting pitcher for that night’s game.</p>
<p>Dorfman was chatting with him, and Mura shook his head silently. When asked what that was about, he said, “I can never win on this mound.” In the ensuing discussion, Dorfman told Mura, “There is a difference between, ‘I have not won and I cannot win’.” After all, there are many things we accomplish for the first time. Otherwise there would be no such thing as breaking one’s personal record.</p>
<p>Dorfman was already guiding Mura toward a problem solving approach by disabusing him of the illusion that past failures <strong><em>must</em></strong> continue forever. Can you see what a silly idea that is? To start with, how many things in life, whether good or bad, last forever?</p>
<p>When questioned further, Mura complained about the height and slope of the pitching mound. Dorfman asked him what kind of adjustments he could make to deal with that. Mura thought it over and came up with a strategy. He had never thought that way before. Instead he had spent his energy telling himself that he couldn’t win in that ballpark.</p>
<p>Mura pitched seven innings that night and gave up only two runs on hits. For those of you who don’t understand baseball, that is a very respectable performance.</p>
<p>Mura began in a state of pessimism and hopelessness. He wasn’t even applying the power of his mind to find solutions. As Dorfman pointed out, why should anyone think about solving the problem if failure is foreordained? And if they do not even begin problem solving, they obviously cannot persist in finding a way to succeed.</p>
<p>Once Mura shifted from pessimism and hopelessness to a problem-solving mode, it took only a few minutes to develop a plan of adjustments that led to success.</p>
<p>We are not saying that it will always be that easy, but you are much more likely to find solutions if you invest your energy in looking for them</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Are you doing things that <strong><em>impair</em></strong> your resilience? Here are some things that can reduce resilience.</p>
<ol start="1">
<li>Don’t develop skills that enable you to sooth, calm, and comfort yourself. (Many, if not most, of <a href="/category/self-soothing/">our posts</a> on this blog explain what those skills are and how to develop them.) The basic ones are very easy to learn.</li>
<li>Don’t fail to apply your resilience skills when they are needed. (You know, “too busy”, “too tired”, “I’ll do this tomorrow”). Here are <a href="/2010/12/06/getting-yourself-to-act-on-what-you-learn-about-building-resilience/">some methods</a> that can help you to get past those excuses and really use the resilience skills that you have.</li>
<li>Don’t underestimate the importance of other people to increasing your resilience (not to mention your health and your success!). For example, be aware of what you may lose by directing your anger and frustration toward supporters. Dumping your distress on supportive others may tempt them to give up or even direct spite at you. For your own sake, you should guide and encourage them. Let them know how they can help, and even give them pep talks.</li>
<li>Don’t do things that increase your distress. For example, inwardly talking to yourself in ways that pump up your anger at people you see as having treated you unfairly. Or selling yourself on the idea that things that distress you make you a helpless victim, who lacks any control over her/his reactions.</li>
<li>Don’t numb your distressed feelings with alcohol or other drugs without even trying to find ways to control your own reactions with skills instead of chemicals.</li>
<li>Don’t allow your routine life to become chaotic without developing at least a few predictable routines. Simplifying your life makes it easier to cope with potentially distressing situations that inevitably come by.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In Contrast, Here Is How Resilient People See It and Do It.</p>
<ul>
<li>I frequently take good care of, calm, and comfort myself.</li>
<li>My typical reaction to a bad situation is to think and do things that make me feel calmer and better.</li>
<li>I know some things I can do to make me feel better when I am upset, and I usually do those things when I am under stress.</li>
<li>I have many predictable routines in my life that give me comfort.</li>
<li>I know that people who try to help me through hard times need some encouragement, and I do my best to give it to them.</li>
<li>I often get to enjoy myself.</li>
<li>I have learned enough about self-calming and self-soothing to recover from challenges by the time I face the difficulties of the next day.</li>
</ul>
<p>To use an already overused saying “Rome wasn’t built in a day”. If things have gotten out of control for you, you will have to take toddler steps toward shifting to a more resilient way of living. Why not work toward developing skills and routines that help make your life less stressful and more successful?</p>
<p>And for heaven’s sake don’t lead with your chin and do things that turn up the intensity of your stress.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Your mental and biological reactions to stress are attempts to help you survive and go on to live a rich life. Stress left unchecked can destroy you. On the other hand, experiencing a level of stress from which you can fairly quickly recover can even make you stronger and more resilient.</p>
<p>The often disturbing mental and biological reactions to stress can be hard to take, but they reflect the best solutions you, and even your biological ancestors, have been able to come up with to deal with life’s challenges.</p>
<p>If you cannot imagine that the stress reactions are helpful and adaptive, think of regular exercise. Exercise is good for you, but is also stressful. It is good for you <strong><em>because </em></strong>it is stressful, and you <strong><em>can handle it.</em></strong></p>
<p>When you exercise, you trigger basic aspects of the classic “fight or flight response”. But if you choose your exercise wisely, you can recover quickly and fully, and your mind and body will eventually change in ways that enable you to take that level of stress in your stride.</p>
<p>If you crank the exercise stress up slowly you are likely to improve your resilience. If you push yourself too much, you can expect to exceed the protective influence of your current resilience skills. If you keep that up, you will eventually experience some kind of breakdown.</p>
<p>On the other hand if you pace yourself carefully, you can improve how quickly and fully you recover from stress. You can become more resilient.</p>
<p>We only mean to use exercise as an <em>example</em> of controlled stress. Though exercise is, indeed, a valuable way to deal with stress, that is not our main message in this post.</p>
<p>Our main point is that, unless stress is extreme and/or perpetuated for a long time, whether you know how to calm down stress reactions, to return to your normal baseline quickly and fully is far more important  than the stress itself to determine whether stress leaves you stronger or breaks you.</p>
<p>In the last few posts, we have focused on techniques that have been tested in people’s lives sometimes for centuries, and have also been shown to be effective when tested scientifically. Specifically, we have explained how to do mantra meditation, and how to practice “loving kindness”. Both of these have been shown to make for a better life.</p>
<p>Before you can use these methods, there is a “learning curve” you must go through to use them. We strongly advocate that you learn how to use them. But there are also methods that most people already know how to use, but that are often not given the respect they deserve. We have described some of these methods <a href="/2010/11/04/natural-stress-defeaters/">here</a>. They include things that do not require you to learn new skills. We derived them by keeping track, over more than a decade, of publications that show how ordinary people, without any special training,  deal with stress.</p>
<p><span id="more-1617"></span></p>
<p>Briefly, examples include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><em>Contact comfort with pets or with people</em></strong>, e.g. cuddling with a pet or loved one; getting a massage.</li>
<li><strong><em>Pleasant, engrossing distraction</em></strong>, e.g. watching comedies, getting out into nature.</li>
<li><strong><em>Soothing sensory stimulation</em></strong>, e.g. taking a hot bath or shower, listening to calming music.</li>
<li><strong><em>Physical activity</em></strong>, e.g. dancing, taking a walk or exercising until you are tired.</li>
<li><strong><em>Contemplative relaxation</em></strong>, e.g. meditation, Yoga.</li>
<li><strong><em>Spiritual activities</em></strong>, e.g. praying, attending religious services.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can add to this whatever you already know works for you. Think over things that have calmed you in the past, and use them when you are distressed.</p>
<p>The trick is to get yourself to actually DO them. For advice on how to do that, click <a href="/2010/12/06/getting-yourself-to-act-on-what-you-learn-about-building-resilience/">here</a>.</p>
<p>The take-home message is to learn the real value of simple things that calm and sooth you, and to make sure you actually do those things when you need them.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Antonovsky">Aaron Antonovsky</a> taught us that stress is so present everywhere that it’s enough to make anyone sick. This means that the biggest payoff in dealing with stress comes from developing more effective ways of viewing and managing stress.</p>
<p>At the same time, he also acknowledged the importance of our physical and social environments in determining our well-being. He believed that by experiencing various sources of support outside of us, in our families and communities, we eventually develop inner attitudes that enable us to deal with life’s challenges on our own.</p>
<p>For example, he pointed out that the very young have to rely on caretakers support, and only in their teens acquire the inner resources that enable resilient adults to handle many potentially damaging experiences. A Baby’s sources of resilience are largely outside in the caretakers. They slowly become inner resources.</p>
<p>Antonovsky’s research, from his years at Harvard and later at David Ben-Gurion University in Israel focused on the outer limits of human stress. At first he studied the poor, who have very little power to change their circumstances.</p>
<p>Later he studied those who survived Nazi concentration camps, who faced boundless animosity and had very little control over what would happen externally in their lives.</p>
<p>In this post we consider some ways in which what is inside interacts with what is outside to make resilience effective. The Biblical story of David and Goliath provides a good example of how what is outside enables inner resilience qualities to be expressed.</p>
<p><span id="more-1539"></span></p>
<p><a href="http://globalpublicsquare.blogs.cnn.com/2013/10/27/gladwell-why-weve-got-david-and-goliath-wrong/?iref=obinsite">Fareed Zacharia</a>  recently interviewed <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malcolm_Gladwell">Malcolm Gladwell</a> about his new book, “<a href="http://www.amazon.com/David-Goliath-Underdogs-Misfits-Battling/dp/0316204366/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1383545663&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=david+and+goliath+malcolm+gladwell">David and Goliath</a>”.(When you click this link, you have to wait through a “message” for a few seconds to see the interview, so be patient}.</p>
<p>Gladwell’s view, based on interviews with various experts, ranging from Rabbis to M.D.s, is that David wasn’t really the underdog. Goliath, he claims, probably was gigantic due to endocrine problems that made him slow, almost blind, and inept.</p>
<p>Another point Gladwell makes is that David used a sling which was, at that time, the latest and most effective weapon available.</p>
<p>Clearly, David was resilient. He went into a battle where the odds appeared to be against him, but found a path to winning. People who do that are resilient, even if the solution is outside them rather than inside them. (What matters is that you get the job done, not the method or resources you use.)</p>
<p>David understood, and almost certainly was practiced in a technology, a sling, that would change the game entirely. It made irrelevant Goliath’s ability to use strength and a sword to win.</p>
<p>David learned to use the sling, and saw that it could defeat Goliath because the “giant’s” traditional weapons were useless when the opponent could strike from enough distance to make strength and a sword irrelevant. And the sling can not only strike from afar, it also has mechanical advantages that enable it to strike with great force.</p>
<p>You may say that David’s approach had nothing to do with inner resilience, which is the kind of resilience we usually emphasize.</p>
<p>But one way to be resilient is to:</p>
<ul>
<li>gather knowledge about new ways to win even if you are at a disadvantage</li>
<li>have the discipline to train yourself in one or more of those techniques and</li>
<li>persist until it is reasonable to bet something important, in this case your life, that you can win with them.</li>
</ul>
<p>Resilience includes learning and practicing techniques that you need to do well in your life. It doesn’t matter whether they are inside you or outside you. The truth is that internal and external resources interact and support each other to make you resilient.</p>
<p>To be resilient, you have to keep your eyes, ears and minds open to learning about available ways to do well, and you have to spend some of your time and energy learning how to apply them to your own life.</p>
<p>Reading the many sources of what will enable you to live well, you could get the impression that there are easy ways that you can master in a few minutes (e.g. the time it takes you to read a list of recommendations). Don’t fall for that. Rarely, that is true. But far more often you have to commit time and effort to developing habits of resilient behavior.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Nobody wants to fail, or, worse, BE a failure. Failure is associated with shame, financial ruin, living a harder life, diminished status, not being able to contribute to your family’s resources.…</p>
<p>Yet, we often see and hear what appears to be praise for failure. What could this be about?</p>
<p><span id="more-1479"></span></p>
<p>People who praise failure are not really talking about a lust for failure; they are talking about an important role of failure in teaching paths to success.</p>
<p>They are also talking about how avoidance of failure, or refusal to acknowledge failure can keep you from understanding what went wrong with your ineffective tries, and thus from seeing how to do better.</p>
<p>Here is an example: Debbie and I often watch Fareed Zakaria’s weekly TV show, “<a href="http://globalpublicsquare.blogs.cnn.com/category/gps-episodes/">GPS</a>” (Global Public Square).  A week or so ago, he interviewed Sara Blakely, an attractive young woman who went from cold call sales of copy machines to creating a business that made her a billionaire. She invented Spanx, an undergarment  she says makes women look better. Obviously many women agree with her.</p>
<p>In that interview, Ms. Blakely talked about the important role of her father in teaching her what it takes to succeed. He taught his children to boldly try new things, and, when they failed praised them for the try and gave them a “high five”.  He taught them not to avoid risk, and to see failure as a positive aspect of life, a key aspect of adaptation to the world as it is.</p>
<p>When Charlie Rose interviewed renowned golf champion, Ben Hogan, he asked Hogan about how he reacted to one of his greatest tournament failures. Hogan said it was the best thing that ever happened to him.  He embraced his mistakes, and learned from them. Many other golf masters have made similar comments.</p>
<p>Placed in the context of the resilience factors we have been discussing in the recent blog posts, these highly accomplished people are expressing  attitudes that are resilient with respect to Factor One (Resilient Attitudes and Skills).  They respond to failures with resilient attitudes  of <span style="text-decoration: underline;">positivity</span> and <span style="text-decoration: underline;">a problem-solving perspective</span>.</p>
<p>In addition, they do not cut their legs out from under themselves with unreasonable self-criticism. So they have resilient qualities reflected in Factor Two (Self-Compassion versus Self-Criticism).</p>
<p>So what the “pro-failure” people are really saying is that we need to grant ourselves the space to learn from our mistakes. If we pass up opportunities in order to avoid risk, or deny our role in failure, we will not learn to adapt to the world we live in.</p>
<p>Making mistakes does not make us “losers”, but we have the option of interpreting our mistakes either in ways that make us lose or in ways that help us win.</p>
<p>Once again, we see the power of “<a href="/2013/04/25/how-to-teach-your-worrier-brain-to-function-like-a-warrior-brain/">Reappraisal</a>”. If we see failure as an opportunity to learn, failure can be a positive influence. If we see it as humiliating, even unspeakable, or give ourselves no option other than to deny that it was our mistake, our adaptation to life will be thwarted.</p>
<p>We do not have to be afraid of making mistakes. Dealing with them is a known path to doing better in life.</p>
<p>Zorba the Greek said “Life is trouble. Only death is not. To be alive is to undo your belt and *look* for trouble.”</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In our last post, we discussed genetic variations that result in our having either a “worrier” or a “warrior” brain. We also mentioned that worriers can handle stress effectively, even function at the level of Navy Seals, if they are properly trained. Sufficiently trained, worriers can deal with demanding situations as well as warriors.</p>
<p>What makes this possible? Despite the bodily stress reactions we have that are inborn, how we <strong><em>interpret</em></strong> those reactions can dramatically shift how we react.</p>
<p><span id="more-1348"></span></p>
<p>In the early 1960s, two psychologists, <a href="http://faculty.babson.edu/krollag/org_site/soc_psych/schachter_epineph.html">Stanley Schachter and Jerome Singer</a> showed that <strong><em>cueing</em></strong> people about how to view their experiences can dramatically shift how they actually react.</p>
<p>Their studies were complex, but, basically, they assessed how the effects of a drug that produced high arousal (standard pharmaceutical adrenalin) changed, depending on the context in which the drug was administered.</p>
<p>If people injected with pharmaceutical adrenalin, which produces a typical stress response with rapid heart rate, sweating, and so forth), were in a situation in which a stooge feigned anger, they were more likely to be angry. If the stooge feigned euphoria, they became more silly and playful.</p>
<p>Anything that changes how we view our bodily reactions has the power to determine whether we end up distressed and defeated or end up feeling euphoric, or heaven knows what else. The point is that the physiological reaction is not the boss. It has a vote, but it’s not the boss.</p>
<p>So if you have powerful feelings and symptoms when you face stress, you can still fall back on your thought patterns to use that power to support you.</p>
<p>Bodily responses to life’s demands commonly provide protection from threats. So getting rid of those reactions is not necessarily a good path to resilience. <a href="http://digitalcommons.unl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1215&amp;context=psychfacpub">Important research</a> shows that those who are resilient have physiological responses to stress as intense as those who are less resilient.</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fight-or-flight_response">Walter Cannon</a>, the scientist who first identified the “fight or flight” stress response did so in a book he entitled “The Wisdom of the Body”.  Wisdom? Can it be that these hated feelings we try to fight off when taking a difficult test, walking on stage to give a speech, etc. are based on bodily “wisdom”?</p>
<p>For example, isn’t your heart pounding rapidly bad for you?</p>
<p>Commonly it is not. Your heart pounds when you exercise vigorously, have sex or ride on a rollercoaster, and we don’t think of that as bad for you. The heart’s reaction during positive states can actually be more intense than it is during negative ones.</p>
<p>It <strong><em>can</em></strong> be bad for you if you have serious heart disease, but that doesn’t mean it’s bad for most of us. Exercise that pushes the heart to be fast and effective is commonly recommended to make us healthier.</p>
<p>The physiological reactions themselves can change depending on how we interpret them. For example, when we interpret something as manageable, our heart’s efficiency tends to increase and our blood vessels relax. When we view them as a threat beyond our control, the opposite happens.</p>
<p>Harvard Professor Jeremy Jamieson and his colleagues have done valuable <a href="http://wendyberrymendes.com/cms/uploads/CDPS_reappraisal-1.pdf">research</a> confirming that how we appraise or interpret our bodily reactions to demanding situations can determine how well we perform under stress.</p>
<p>For example, in one study, in a high-stakes testing situation half of the test-takers were told before the test that stress reactions we have during important, difficult tests predict better, not worse performance. They were also told that they should not feel concerned about their body’s reactions, but instead should remind themselves that this arousal could be helping them do well.</p>
<p>The group taught to see stress reactions as beneficial scored 65 points higher than controls!</p>
