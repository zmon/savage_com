				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The second most important resilience factor has to do with some very self-defeating things that people do that make them less resilient. It involves amplifying stress instead of getting it in control.</p>
<p>I see it all the time; something distressing happens and people react by tearing themselves down with self-criticism, and often go on to spread the criticism to, and generate fights with the very people who could help them recover quickly, which would be the path of resilience and both mental and physical health.</p>
<p>The core pattern of the factor was over-reacting to even small errors or failings by worrying about what we have done and how other people might react to our missteps. This leads to worrying about and criticizing ourselves for real or imagined failings.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QE1vnHfOcnU">This animation</a>, voiced by Jennifer Lopez, may help you to see the kinds of criticisms and attacks we have in mind. Similar examples can be found <a href="/2011/03/22/self-compassion-and-resilience/">here</a>.</p>
<p><span id="more-1413"></span></p>
<p>Our focus is on resilience, the positive things you can do to deal with stress and live a better life, so we are not interested in lamenting what is wrong with things we do, but with how we stay strong, healthy, and live well even if we have messed up.</p>
<p>We pondered and discussed Factor 2 (which we dubbed, perhaps clumsily, “Hypersensitivity, Self-Criticism/Perfectionism) for many years, frequently attempting to pinpoint the positive, resilience-promoting patterns implied by its negative, depleting ways.</p>
<p>Doing this blog and constantly looking for new approaches to enhance resilience led us to see what that resilience-promoting factor was.</p>
<p>We discovered an important body of research on self-compassion. If you are self-compassionate, you are not likely to be severely and unreasonably critical of your mistakes.</p>
<p>Self-compassion is the closest we are likely to find to the opposite of the intense and unreasonable self-criticism and demanding perfectionism reflected in Factor 2.</p>
<p>To give you a better sense of what factor two is about, here are some patterns embedded in it.</p>
<p>If you change on any of these patterns, you are also changing your standing on the factor itself. Here are more details:</p>
<ul>
<li>Self-Evaluations that are Critical and Unreasonably Demanding versus Reasonable Self-Compassion, and Realistic yet Loving, and Accepting Self-Evaluations.</li>
<li>Worry/Rumination versus, Focusing on the Present, and Taking Things One at a Time.</li>
<li>Unreasonable Expectations/Perfectionism. The more resilient polarity of this is recognizing that we all have limitations and that errors are natural in human life and deserve compassion. Failures, handled well, can even help by teaching us better ways of managing our lives.</li>
</ul>
<p>Knowing the factors is useful, but knowing ways you can change where you stand on them is more important. In a number of our previous blog posts we have discussed what to do if you need to improve on these patterns:</p>
<ol start="1">
<li>Learn how to offer yourself warmth and non-judgmental understanding rather than belittling your pain or berating yourself with self-criticism. <a href="/2012/01/03/from-negative-thinking-and-self-criticism-to-positive-thinking-and-self-compassion/?#more-891">This previous post</a> explains a useful way to reduce your self-negativity.</li>
<li>The ordinary human mind is chaotic; there is ancient expression that “The mind is a drunken monkey”. If you are a strong self-critic, you need to help yourself become more even-minded, and meditation will do that. <a href="/2011/03/02/basic-mindfulness-technique/">Here</a> is one of our earlier posts on a very popular, effective method of meditation.</li>
<li>Some things you can do to help with perfectionism are in <a href="/2011/02/20/to-increase-your-resilience-avoid-being-too-hard-on-yourself/">this post</a>.</li>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Earlier, I explained that there are <a href="../../../../../2011/01/11/the-three-core-factors-that-can-make-you-more-resilient/">three factors that indicate whether people are resilient</a>. For this post, I want to go back to the second resilience factor, discussed previously, about <a href="../../../../../2011/02/20/to-increase-your-resilience-avoid-being-too-hard-on-yourself/">not being too hard on yourself</a>.</p>
<p>Many of us attack ourselves when we are down. Here are some words <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Mental-ABCs-Pitching-Performance-Enhancement/dp/1888698292/ref=sr_1_3?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1300375346&amp;sr=1-3">Harvey Dorfman</a>, a major league pitching coach heard his extremely talented athletes apply to themselves: “idiot,” “loser,” “dummy,” “gutless,” and “I stink,” “I can’t,” “I don’t have it,” and “I’m clueless.” Notice that these are nasty and inaccurate. Even if on a given occasion they had made a mistake, they wouldn’t be major league pitchers if they were losers, idiots, etc.</p>
<p>Recently Glamor Magazine did a <a href="http://www.glamour.com/health-fitness/2011/02/shocking-body-image-news-97-percent-of-women-will-be-cruel-to-their-bodies-today">survey of women’s attitudes toward their bodies</a>, and here are some things the surveyed women had to say about themselves: “You are a fat, worthless pig.” “You’re too thin. No man is ever going to want you.” “Ugly. Big. Gross.” Ninety-seven percent of surveyed women had at least one such thought per day and, on average, the women had close to one of these thoughts per waking hour.</p>
<p>As a full-time professor I used to lecture on overweight, obesity, and weight loss. I always marveled at the intense attention students, especially women, gave as I spoke. Very lovely, well-formed women whom any sensible person would see as attractive were intensely interested in how to lose weight. And they were more than willing to listen to a paunchy professor tell them how to do that!</p>
<p>People who tend to speak abusively to themselves diminish their level of resilience, and so presumably lose at least some of the many advantages of being resilient. We are talking, after all, about the second most important resilience factor.</p>
<p>If, when under stress, we are nasty to ourselves, we just ratchet up the mental and physical stress reactions, and slow our recovery.</p>
<p>Recently the New York Times ran an article centering on <a href="http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/02/28/go-easy-on-yourself-a-new-wave-of-research-urges/">the work of Kristin Neff on Self-Compassion</a>. By going to <a href="https://webspace.utexas.edu/neffk/pubs/listofpublications.htm">Dr. Neff’s website</a>, I saw that this topic has been the subject of a lot of research, not just by her, but by many others. Somehow I had missed it, despite my constant efforts to find <em>everything</em> relevant to resilience.</p>
<p>Her work took me one step further in clarifying what that second resilience factor is. It is about being compassionate toward yourself. To me that feels richer than merely putting an end to being mean to yourself. Compassion is not just the absence of meanness. It implies treating yourself in a caring, understanding, and loving way.</p>
<p>I am going to end this post with a valuable quotation from a <a href="https://webspace.utexas.edu/neffk/pubs/JRP.pdf">paper by Dr. Neff</a> that clarifies the concept of self-compassion:</p>
<p>“If individuals are self-compassionate when confronting suffering, inadequacy or failure, it means that they offer themselves warmth and non-judgmental understanding rather than belittling their pain or berating themselves with self-criticism.”</p>
