				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For people who are new to this blog, we have been reviewing the three core factors that underlie resilience. Probably some of the original readers have forgotten those factors, so this review may be useful to them too.</p>
<p>In the previous two posts we described the first two factors. Here we deal with the third and final factor. This factor has to do with expressing or articulating your inner reactions to distressing situations.</p>
<p>James Pennebaker and his colleagues did a series of studies that linked expressiveness to improved physical and mental health. This work was summarized in Pennebaker’s book “<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Opening-Up-Healing-Expressing-Emotions/dp/1572302380/ref=sr_1_2?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1374426455&amp;sr=1-2&amp;keywords=james+pennebaker">Opening Up: The Healing Power of Confiding in Others</a>”. Basically, they showed that clarifying and speaking of your feelings about things that distress you led to improved mental and even physical health.</p>
<p>It is easy to confuse the self-expression Pennebaker and his colleagues advocate with other actions that can even be damaging, so we will clarify the details of how to be expressive.</p>
<h4><strong>What You Need to Do to Improve Your Self-Understanding and To Express It.</strong></h4>
<p><span id="more-1423"></span></p>
<p>To articulate your reactions, the first step is to understand them. You can, most likely, improve your understanding of your own reactions by way of inner dialogue. But there are advantages to having someone else also understand you.</p>
<p>Effective communication often happens in psychotherapy, but it also can take place in serious conversations with caring friends and other people who are good listeners, patient, and willing to let you know when they don’t understand.</p>
<p>If you have the right kind of listener, you might also have a dialogue that improves both their and your understanding of how you feel and why you feel as you do. It requires you to be very clear about your feelings because it is very hard to explain them in a way that effectively communicates them to others.</p>
<p>Both self-understanding and self-expression are of remarkable value in helping you keep in check what might otherwise be a damaging stress reaction.</p>
<h4><strong>Journaling</strong></h4>
<p>Though there is a clear advantage to effectively sharing your deep feelings with supportive friends, such sharing is not always easy or even possible.</p>
<p>In such cases, <a href="http://homepage.psy.utexas.edu/homepage/faculty/pennebaker/home2000/WritingandHealth.html">writing down how you have reacted to a troubling situation</a>, even without an outside listener, can be helpful. Studies have shown that writing a journal that focuses on expressing how you feel about hurtful experiences diminishes their negative consequences.</p>
<p>The following video has the founder of this journaling method showing how it is done:<br />
<iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/XsHIV9PxAV4?rel=0" frameborder="0" width="640" height="360"></iframe></p>
<h4><strong>A Special Kind of Focusing</strong></h4>
<p>Another method of clarifying feelings is through a process called Focusing. Privately talking to yourself about how you feel can be worth a lot. However, you have to focus in a specific way, emphasizing how you feel, and paying attention to your body’s reactions as you go through this inner dialogue.</p>
<p>The special kind of <a href="/2011/05/13/relieve-distress-with-extra-ordinary-focusing/">focusing</a> developed by Eugene Gendlin is an outstanding way to learn from those bodily reactions. This special kind of focusing is not easy to explain, and we think that <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Power-Focusing-Practical-Emotional-Self-Healing/dp/157224044X/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1374042330&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=ann+cornell+weiser">Ann Cornell Weiser</a> has done the best job we have seen in explaining how to focus.</p>
<p>We often think that just keeping quiet about our feelings and ignoring them can make them irrelevant to our mental and physiological functions. James Lynch has shown clearly that emotions that cannot be formulated in our mind enough to be spoken or written tend to be expressed in harmful physiological reactions, for example, in elevated blood pressure.</p>
<p>Lynch’s work is not as well known as it should be. If his books are not available in your library, you could get them on <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Language-Heart-Bodys-Response-Dialogue/dp/046503795X/ref=sr_1_5?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1374042815&amp;sr=1-5&amp;keywords=James+Lynch">Amazon</a>, but as of this writing they are available on <a href="http://www.abebooks.com/servlet/SearchResults?an=James+Lynch&amp;sts=t&amp;tn=The+language+of+the+heart">Abebooks</a> for as little as $1.00 plus a few dollars in shipping fees.</p>
<p>He did extensive research on people who did not respond well to medicines in reducing dangerously high blood pressure. He concluded that they were often expressing their emotions by way of these elevations of blood pressure.</p>
<p>Learning to understand our reactions and express them in words instead of bodily reactions helps us be more resilient. This is not the same as “<a href="/2011/04/18/articulation-of-feelings-is-not-the-same-as-venting/">getting our anger out</a>”.  That is more likely to be damaging than helpful.</p>
<p>Learning to understand what you really feel about what is going in your life is healthy but take care that you express those feeling in situations that do not unnecessarily trigger hostile reactions in others.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>What should we do with anger bottled up inside of us? A <a href="http://articles.washingtonpost.com/2013-05-20/national/39387984_1_heart-attack-elizabeth-mostofsky-risk">recent article in the Washington Post</a> discussed a serious effect of one option, that of letting out the raw anger, even to the point of throwing things and threatening to hurt other people.</p>
<p>A common theme for some mental health professionals has been that we should get the anger out. For these therapists, sessions can consist of banging a pillow (usually representing  parents who were taken as having failed the client), with a bat that has many of the properties of a nasty club, but is in fact safely padded.</p>
<p>The Washington Post article describes a study in which about 4000 people who had heart attacks were asked about their experiences of anger. Heart attacks were twice as likely to occur after an episode of anger. There was a tendency for the heart attacks to occur within two hours of the anger episode.</p>
<p>Patients were also asked to rate how intense their anger episode had been, and the more intense the anger episode, the more likely patients were to have a heart attack.</p>
<p>So we have therapists trying to help us get the anger out versus research showing that expressing anger can lead to a heart attack.  So what are we to do? Should we bottled up our anger or express it?</p>
<p><span id="more-1382"></span></p>
<p>The Washington Post article says that “Bottling up of emotions is thought to harm both mind and body, but a new study suggests that doing the opposite may be no better.” What I want to do here is to be sure readers don’t take the options as limited to either “bottling up” or “doing the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">opposite</span>”, blowing your stack.</p>
<p>There is a lot of research indicating that, even though <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Anger-Misunderstood-Emotion-Carol-Tavris/dp/0671675230/ref=sr_1_3?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1369798270&amp;sr=1-3&amp;keywords=carol+tavris">letting out raw anger</a> harms you, striving to get clear about, articulate, and express your emotions has positive effects on the mind and body, not to mention on social relationships.</p>
<p>This is very different from blowing your stack or “<a href="/2011/04/18/articulation-of-feelings-is-not-the-same-as-venting/">venting</a>”, which has long been known to be an ineffective and typically damaging way to deal with distressing experiences.</p>
<p>It is important to learn how to <a href="/2011/05/03/focusing-a-highly-effective-way-to-resolve-distress/">understand your feelings when distressed</a>, and to articulate them without unnecessarily alienating others, especially others who might be able to help you minimize any potential damage coming from your stress. “Blowing your stack” is almost certain to amplify the impact of stress.</p>
<p>With stress amplification, your response to stress increases the physiological responses that make heart attacks more likely. That kind of response also may alienate your potential support systems and thus make   you less resilient and more vulnerable. It’s amazing how many people follow this totally ineffective pattern of stress management.</p>
<p>Your anger is there to protect you. It helps you to push against obstacles that can block you from reaching your goals, including people who are trying to dominate you in order to reach their own goals.</p>
<p>If you use anger well, it will be a powerful source of energy to help you reach your goals.</p>
<p>If, instead, you amplify the impact of your stress, you become your own enemy, often your own worst enemy.</p>
<p>To deal with anger you should not act on it. Don’t let your brain’s motor system rule you. You should attend to the anger and find out what it means.</p>
<p>To do this, you have to <a title="open a mental space in which you can gain a deep understanding of why you are angry" href="/2011/05/03/focusing-a-highly-effective-way-to-resolve-distress/">open a mental space in which you can gain a deep understanding of why you are angry</a>.</p>
<p>That way you are more likely to move toward your sensible goals instead of undermining yourself.</p>
<p>You should take time to attend to your angry reactions, focusing first on what you feel in your body.  Visit with those bodily reactions until they can be expressed in words.</p>
<p>When you do that, you shift from unwise, primitive commands from the parts of your brain that lead to mindless action. Instead you pull together and synthesize thoughts with emotions and then take action.</p>
<p>That synthesis is most likely to be the creative source of actions that are both wise and effective.</p>
