				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When we discussed the Sense of Coherence in our previous post, we said that it was a match for the first factor in our three factor model of resilience.</p>
<p>In both popular culture (e.g. Rev. Normal Vincent Peale’s “The Power of Positive Thinking” which had a huge impact in the United States and elsewhere) and scientifically developed theory (e.g. Barbara Frederickson’s book, “Positivity”), the value of positivity has been recognized as playing a major role in lives well-lived.</p>
<p>But we see a distinction between attitudes of positivity and positive skills that are closely connected to those attitudes.</p>
<p>Probably most people would predict that positive attitudes and thoughts are related to resilience. But having skills such as knowing ways to calm and soothe yourself when distressed have been given less attention. In addition, many of us possess the needed skills, but do not implement them.</p>
<p>Once we take the skills to the point where we actually implement them when they are needed, we have reached the third level of using resilience tools, the level of habit.</p>
<p>In sum, we have to go from attitudes to skills and on to habits.</p>
<p>Isn’t this a lot of work? It can be, but for the most part the process is very enjoyable, even exhilarating at times.</p>
<p>Do we need to say that we think you should give it a try?</p>
<p>If you decide to do that, <a href="/2014/12/22/prepare-for-your-later-life-by-accumulating-skills-and-habits-of-resilience/">this</a> and <a href="/2014/10/08/build-your-toughness-and-become-more-resilient/">this</a> will help get you started.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>While preparing our previous post on using breath control to relax, we ran into some technical barriers to uploading one of our relaxation audios to the post. Rather than add delays to uploading the post, we decided to select from the multitude of videos offered on You Tube.</p>
<p>We were aghast to find that almost all of the videos made a fundamental mistake that would likely keep people from developing the awareness of muscular tension that is central to relaxation training in which you deliberately alternate tensing and relaxing carefully attending to and contrasting the two states.</p>
<p>Most of the videos instructed people to tighten muscles very strongly, even “as hard as you can”.</p>
<p>The central idea of progressive relaxation is to become sensitive even to slight amounts of tension and learn to shut that tension off.</p>
<p>Contracting strongly will relax you briefly because it is isometric exercise. It do little to teach you to recognize the tensions of anxiety or to control them.</p>
<p>Progressive Relaxation (PR) was developed by Edmund Jacobsen, an M.D. Ph.D with a strong background in physiological research. He also introduced a newly developed tool, the electromyography, so could measure tension objectively.</p>
<p>Anyone who has observed the direct readings of muscular tension that an EMG provides can tell you that it is common for people to report being totally relaxed when they are still far from it.</p>
<p>The main focus of PR was to learn to recognize muscular tension and how to release it. Jacobson’s technique started with learning to recognize tension when you place your forearm, bottom side down, on a flat surface and then gently point your fingers up toward the ceiling. At a later stage, he even had trainees lift the fingers only a small distance upward. This is far from tensing “as hard as you can”!</p>
<p>He also had trainees go through these procedures progressively, throughout the body until they reached a point where they were aware even of slight amounts of tension and knew how to shut the tension down.</p>
<p>PR has played an important role in many effective stress coping techniques so it’s worthwhile to review its core principles.<br />
<span id="more-1940"></span></p>
<p>Core Principles of Progressive Relaxation</p>
<p>• Normally people cannot identify muscular tension accurately.<br />
• If your brain stops sending your muscles signals to tense, you will be completely relaxed.<br />
• Relaxation is not doing. “Doing” works when you are trying to INITIATE an action to get something done. That creates more muscular tension, which is useful most of the time, but not when you are trying to relax.<br />
• If your muscles stop contracting, you will no longer be psychologically tense. The mind is much more dependent on muscular action than most of us realize.<br />
• You can relax below your “zero point” (the point where, as an untrained person you think you are fully relaxed).<br />
In our experience, really tense people may be utterly oblivious to sensations of tension, because their chronic tenseness becomes their normal “zero point”, and they think that anything below that is deep relaxation.</p>
<p>Where Jacobson Was Right and Where He Was Wrong</p>
<p>Evidence supports the idea that relaxation of muscles is a powerful relaxant of the mind, and Jacobson was right to give it a central place in his training. There has been strong evidence that his method works. It is wise to use relaxation techniques that are consistent with his core principles.</p>
<p>However, there is clear evidence that the mind, including the emotions, continues to function even when skeletal muscles are completely blocked by a drug. The drug used to show this was a refined derivative of curare. Curare is a drug put on the tips of darts by certain South American Indians to kill prey. We now know that it works by blocking the chemical transmitter that enables the nervous system to control the muscles.</p>
<p>During the mid-1940s two anesthesiologists, Frederick Prescott in the UK and Scott Smith in the US independently volunteered to be “guinea pigs” to test the effects of a purified form of curare. Their breathing was maintained mechanically.</p>
<p>They knew it would paralyze their muscles, but wanted to know whether it would also make them unconscious.Some doctors were doing surgery on the assumption that under the influence of the drug patients were unconscious and did not feel pain.</p>
<p>When these two doctors volunteered to be paralyzed by the drug, including high doses, they later reported that their mental processes, including emotions and feelings of distress, persisted. Curare and it’s more refined derivatives should not be used as an anesthetic.</p>
<p>Both had a rapid heartrate and elevated blood pressure. Prescott attributed this to emotion, saying that “… one cannot be paralyzed and remain perfectly tranquil”.</p>
<p>This clearly shows that, though relaxing skeletal muscles helps relax the mind, when the muscles are completely paralyzed, one can react with a loss of “tranquility”.</p>
<p>Progressive Relaxation is an excellent way to relax, but it’s is not a cure-all for distress.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We have often pointed out, maybe even emphasized, how <em>easy</em> it is to learn techniques that are helpful in resisting and recovering from stress.</p>
<p>The techniques are not only easy, but are typically pleasant and comforting. Most resilience training methods make you feel somewhere in the range of good to very good.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, too many people practice for a while, but then get embedded in the demands of ordinary life and never get to see how rich the benefits might be if they continued over the long term.</p>
<p>Take <a href="/2010/12/06/a-key-step-in-resilience-training-is-learning-deep-relaxation/">deep relaxation</a> as an example. A large majority of people who try basic methods of deep relaxation find the states they induce both useful and pleasant.</p>
<p>They should consider persisting at least a little longer. For some methods of relaxation and calming, there is evidence that practice can continue to improve, even over many years.</p>
<p>A striking example is the work of a Japanese researcher, Tomio Hirai. He studied changes in brain waves that take place when people practice Zen Meditation. (It is called “Zazen” and is essentially identical to the currently popular “Mindfulness Meditation”).</p>
<p><span id="more-1709"></span></p>
<p>Zazen involves sitting in a stable posture and attending to your breathing. The goal is to do that and nothing else.</p>
<p>Beginners count their inhalations and exhalations from one to ten; then they go back to one and start over again. If you try this for a while you will find yourself counting numbers like “42”, indicating that your mind has wandered without your noticing it. When this happens you just calmly go back to one.</p>
<p>As time goes on, brain wave patterns shift from fast to slow (an indication of calm, deep relaxation, the antithesis of a stress response, a “relaxation response”).</p>
<p>Hirai found that even after decades of practice meditators <a href="http://is.muni.cz/www/178816/EEG_and_Zazen.pdf">are still improving</a>.</p>
<p>But their commitment to meditation is not just to deal with life’s frustrations. As part of a Buddhist tradition, it is done to achieve some form of “enlightenment”, a profound and highly beneficial readjustment of their perceptions of themselves and of the world.</p>
<p>Zen masters recognize and accept that many people who practice Zazen, do so in order to function better in their ordinary lives. The term “<a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=KczYq22WAeYC&amp;pg=PA49&amp;lpg=PA49&amp;dq=bompu+zen&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=igVZJ2sn_3&amp;sig=7PRrXKcW1ep0fUHZCShYKcRc_cc&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=3rfdU_POGKLT8AGjvoCgCg&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CFIQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=bompu%20zen&amp;f=false">Bompu Zen</a>” is used for this more basic approach.</p>
<p>What resilience training normally aims to achieve is at the level of Bompu Zen. This does not meant that it is <em>merely</em> bompu Zen. We, for example, include the most effective techniques from a wide variety of traditions and other sources, as long as their effectiveness is robust enough to be empirically confirmed.</p>
<p>It appears that “the sky is the limit” when it comes to how far you can go with your training. Whether you reach for the sky depends on your ultimate goals. It depends on whether you seek a radically new perspective on the world and your life or just want to deal more effectively with life’s familiar demands, which is, incidentally, the humble goal we have chosen for this blog.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Our core purpose at OnResilience is to explain how and why you should train to be more resilient. We want to help people learn techniques that can help them get through difficult situations and come out able to at least stay in the game, and maybe also having learned things that make them more effective in handling difficulties to come.</p>
<p>Debbie and I both know from published research, our own personal experiences, and our work as trainers and therapists that the techniques we teach will help most people to deal more effectively with painful, threatening situations .</p>
<p>A fortunate few can get benefits from just a few training sessions. But most people need more help, and, especially, more practice than that. However, it is safe to say that no one who neglects practice will reach their potential even if they are in the above-mentioned “fortunate few”.</p>
<p>Why do so many people fail to practice resilience-inducing procedures?</p>
<p>A possible reason is that people in technically advanced parts of the world have become accustomed to treatments that require little effort. Most of us have gotten prescriptions that quickly relieved us of distressing diseases, and we may tend now to expect a quick, almost effortless resolution to any of our problems. The old Alka-Seltzer line, “Relief is just a swallow away”, says it all.</p>
<p>That “take a pill” model is usually not a good one for making changes in the way the mind, or, if you prefer, the brain, influences the body. Nor does it work particularly well if we need to maneuver our way through complicated situations, such as a troubled marriage. In these situations, many factors influence what happens, and these factors may include some that can be influenced by chemicals, but we are far from having pills, injections, or surgical procedures that do much to turn complex situations from bad to good.</p>
<p>For the most part, neither can listening to a lecture or two, or practicing mind-body techniques a few times.</p>
<p>To get the most out of resilience training you need “practice, practice, and practice”.</p>
<p>But many, many people just do not see any room in their available <em>time</em> to fit practice in.</p>
<p><span id="more-1685"></span></p>
<p>Both Debbie and I have “been there and done that”.  We understand how hard it can be to find the time and energy to practice.</p>
<p>So, granting that we have to practice in order to see what resilience techniques can really do to make our lives better, <strong><em>how much</em></strong> practice is required?</p>
<p>Malcolm Gladwell in his best-selling book, “<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Outliers-Story-Success-Malcolm-Gladwell/dp/0316017930/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1405436934&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=gladwell+outliers">Outliers</a>” concluded that mastering a skill requires practicing 10,000 times. Fortunately, in the video below, the speaker makes a case for 20 practice sessions as enough to reach the modest goals most of us set for ourselves.</p>
<p>Gladwell has been a brilliant commentator on life, but this encouraging video should help those of you who cannot fit that much practice into the stream of your life. It deals with people who, like most of us, are not aiming for goals that would make us world champions, but, rather for goals that make our lives better and, perhaps goals that make us stand out as notably good at what we are trying to do.</p>
<p>Watch the video for encouraging information on what you can gain from fairly modest effort.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Antonovsky">Aaron Antonovsky</a> taught us that stress is so present everywhere that it’s enough to make anyone sick. This means that the biggest payoff in dealing with stress comes from developing more effective ways of viewing and managing stress.</p>
<p>At the same time, he also acknowledged the importance of our physical and social environments in determining our well-being. He believed that by experiencing various sources of support outside of us, in our families and communities, we eventually develop inner attitudes that enable us to deal with life’s challenges on our own.</p>
<p>For example, he pointed out that the very young have to rely on caretakers support, and only in their teens acquire the inner resources that enable resilient adults to handle many potentially damaging experiences. A Baby’s sources of resilience are largely outside in the caretakers. They slowly become inner resources.</p>
<p>Antonovsky’s research, from his years at Harvard and later at David Ben-Gurion University in Israel focused on the outer limits of human stress. At first he studied the poor, who have very little power to change their circumstances.</p>
<p>Later he studied those who survived Nazi concentration camps, who faced boundless animosity and had very little control over what would happen externally in their lives.</p>
<p>In this post we consider some ways in which what is inside interacts with what is outside to make resilience effective. The Biblical story of David and Goliath provides a good example of how what is outside enables inner resilience qualities to be expressed.</p>
<p><span id="more-1539"></span></p>
<p><a href="http://globalpublicsquare.blogs.cnn.com/2013/10/27/gladwell-why-weve-got-david-and-goliath-wrong/?iref=obinsite">Fareed Zacharia</a>  recently interviewed <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malcolm_Gladwell">Malcolm Gladwell</a> about his new book, “<a href="http://www.amazon.com/David-Goliath-Underdogs-Misfits-Battling/dp/0316204366/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1383545663&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=david+and+goliath+malcolm+gladwell">David and Goliath</a>”.(When you click this link, you have to wait through a “message” for a few seconds to see the interview, so be patient}.</p>
<p>Gladwell’s view, based on interviews with various experts, ranging from Rabbis to M.D.s, is that David wasn’t really the underdog. Goliath, he claims, probably was gigantic due to endocrine problems that made him slow, almost blind, and inept.</p>
<p>Another point Gladwell makes is that David used a sling which was, at that time, the latest and most effective weapon available.</p>
<p>Clearly, David was resilient. He went into a battle where the odds appeared to be against him, but found a path to winning. People who do that are resilient, even if the solution is outside them rather than inside them. (What matters is that you get the job done, not the method or resources you use.)</p>
<p>David understood, and almost certainly was practiced in a technology, a sling, that would change the game entirely. It made irrelevant Goliath’s ability to use strength and a sword to win.</p>
<p>David learned to use the sling, and saw that it could defeat Goliath because the “giant’s” traditional weapons were useless when the opponent could strike from enough distance to make strength and a sword irrelevant. And the sling can not only strike from afar, it also has mechanical advantages that enable it to strike with great force.</p>
<p>You may say that David’s approach had nothing to do with inner resilience, which is the kind of resilience we usually emphasize.</p>
<p>But one way to be resilient is to:</p>
<ul>
<li>gather knowledge about new ways to win even if you are at a disadvantage</li>
<li>have the discipline to train yourself in one or more of those techniques and</li>
<li>persist until it is reasonable to bet something important, in this case your life, that you can win with them.</li>
</ul>
<p>Resilience includes learning and practicing techniques that you need to do well in your life. It doesn’t matter whether they are inside you or outside you. The truth is that internal and external resources interact and support each other to make you resilient.</p>
<p>To be resilient, you have to keep your eyes, ears and minds open to learning about available ways to do well, and you have to spend some of your time and energy learning how to apply them to your own life.</p>
<p>Reading the many sources of what will enable you to live well, you could get the impression that there are easy ways that you can master in a few minutes (e.g. the time it takes you to read a list of recommendations). Don’t fall for that. Rarely, that is true. But far more often you have to commit time and effort to developing habits of resilient behavior.</p>

Our posts tend to be on specific attitudes or actions that are statistically confirmed aspects of one of the three factors. That is not because we select them only if they match our model. Our model just matches the data.</p>
<p>The blog was not started to publicize or support the model. It started as an outlet to keep me from constantly adding new findings to a book Debbie and I wrote to teach people how to improve their resilience.</p>
<p>To identify the core factors that underlie resilience we used a method called factor analysis. Done correctly, it can reveal the deep structure of whatever you are studying. So, for example, if you used it on three dimensional objects, like boxes, it would tell you that there are three dimensions, height, width and length.</p>
<p>We determined the dimensions of resilience and found that there were three. We also replicated that finding in two additional studies, and both of them confirmed the three dimensions.</p>
<p>To explain the factors here would be redundant, since we have already done that in <a href="/2011/01/11/the-three-core-factors-that-can-make-you-more-resilient/">this post</a>.</p>
<p>For now, we will discuss the number one factor that improves resilience.</p>
<h2>What good is this to you?</h2>
<p>Knowing the core dimensions will help you pinpoint all you can do to improve your resilience.</p>
<p>The number one influence on resilience is developing resilience-promoting  <strong><em>attitudes</em></strong> and <strong><em>skills</em></strong>.  These account for so much of resilience that, for a while, I was tempted to think of Factor One alone as just plain resilience, and ignore the other two factors. But too much evidence showed that those factors can be crucial for many people.</p>
<p>So what are the attitudes and skills you should try to develop?</p>
<p><span id="more-1392"></span></p>
<ul>
<li>Being optimistic and hopeful instead of pessimistic and hopeless.</li>
<li>Seeing distressing or painful life events as problems to be solved instead of things to be lamented and cursed.</li>
<li>Looking for and maybe even finding meaning in what we do and what we experience instead of just slogging through life.</li>
<li>Learning how to sooth, calm and replenish yourself, and then <strong><em>applying what you have learned </em></strong>to your everyday life when you are distressed, and also when you are feeling okay. (The latter is important in order to develop <strong><em>habits</em></strong> of resilience.).</li>
</ul>
<p>Some of the attitudes under factor one that help us be more resilient are</p>
<ol start="1">
<li>Being optimistic and hopeful versus viewing life with pessimism or despair.</li>
</ol>
<p>Here are posts that tell you how to do that:</p>
<p><a href="/2011/01/01/less-pessimism-and-more-optimism-will-build-your-resilience/">Increasing your optimism.</a></p>
<p><a href="/2012/08/02/reducing-negativity-in-your-mind-and-your-life/">Decreasing your negativity.</a></p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Viewing our lives, our choices, and our actions as meaningful versus seeing them as meaningless.</li>
</ol>
<p>Here is a post to help you do that.</p>
<p><a href="/2011/11/28/finding-meaning-and-purpose-can-help-you-deal-with-distress-no-matter-how-extreme/">Finding  meaning.</a></p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Taking a problem-solving attitude toward stressful situations and anticipating predictable complications.</li>
</ol>
<p>Here is a post that shows you how to do that:</p>
<p><a href="/2012/08/02/reducing-negativity-in-your-mind-and-your-life/">Problem-Solving Attitude.</a></p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Learning and applying  the skills that sooth and replenish you instead of taking actions that make things worse.</li>
</ol>
<p>There are many posts that show how to do that:</p>
<p><a href="/2011/03/02/basic-mindfulness-technique/">Training yourself in mindfulness.</a></p>
<p><a href="/2011/06/02/tactical-breathing-can-stop-stress-on-the-spot/">Breath control for resilience.</a></p>

<p>I don’t remember where I first ran into the concept of overthinking, but it appealed to me. Both Debbie and I understand the limitations of the parts of the brain that underlie thinking. We also are aware of the often unrecognized strengths of the “emotional brain”, which is commonly regarded as a giving birth to mere “fluff”.</p>
<p>Emotion is certainly not “fluff”.<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Descartes-Error-Emotion-Reason-Human/dp/014303622X/ref=sr_1_3?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1368458741&amp;sr=1-3&amp;keywords=antonio+damasio"> Antonio and Hannah Da Massio</a> have shown that we need cooperation between the emotional brain and the thinking brain in order to deal with the real world. They showed that people with brain injuries that left both their thinking and their emotional brains intact, but blocked them from cooperating with each other resulted in smart people with extremely poor judgment.</p>
<p>These people could do very well on IQ tests, and even give intelligent answers to questions like “How many giraffes are there in the United States” that require creative and complicated thinking strategies.</p>
<p>So, when I ran into several articles about overthinking, I already knew that placing too much emphasis on thinking and too little on feeling and emotions would lead to poor outcomes. So the word “overthinking” grabbed my attention.</p>
<p>The go-to book on overthinking is one called “<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Women-Who-Think-Too-Much/dp/0805075259/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1368459003&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=women+who+think+too+muchhttp://">Women Who Think Too Much</a>” by Prof. Susan Noel-Hoeksema. (Why just women? She pointed out that women are more likely than men to overthink. That is true, but actually, the few available research <a href="http://www.refocuser.com/2009/08/9-ways-to-stop-overthinking-everything/">sources</a> indicate a small, though statistically significant difference. So the book is also useful for guys).</p>
<p>As I began working my way through the book, I was impressed, and I recommended it to Debbie.</p>
<p>But, eventually I saw that reading the book is like taking a ride on a roller coaster, with the excitement and fun of learning alternating with pages of tedium. (This was my experience, not necessarily the objective truth.)</p>
<p>The best thing about the book is that it is full of methods for reducing overthinking.</p>
<p>So, here is my take:</p>
<p><span id="more-1370"></span></p>
<p>What is overthinking? Professor Noel-Hoeksema describes it as “going over and over your negative thoughts and feelings, kneading them like dough. She applies the term the “yeast effect”.  “Just as yeasty bread dough will double in size after it’s been kneaded, our negative thoughts expand, grow, and begin to take up all the space around them in our minds.”</p>
<p>We have always emphasized the damaging effects of stress amplification in limiting resilience. That last thing you should do when times are harsh is to alienate your supporters, tear yourself down, exaggerate your hopelessness… You get the idea- when you are in a distressing situation, you need someone who is on your side, but also smart about what helps and what hurts.</p>
<p>Clearly it doesn’t sound like a good thing to overthink. Research has linked it to depression. “When sadness is amplified instead of managed, it can take you down paths to hopelessness, self-hate, and immobility.”</p>
<p>It also increases anxiety, which can lead to a nasty physiological and psychological avalanche, ending in chronic arousal that “wears down the body” and eventually makes it hard for you to deal with even mildly challenging situations. All we can say is “Amen”.</p>
<p>So what can you do about overthinking? Here is a mix of examples from her book and some others that we think are also useful:</p>
<ul>
<li>Look for interpretations of distressing events that are not as damning as the ones that first come to mind.  Could nasty, critical comments about you be wrong, even silly and more about the critic than about you?</li>
<li>You should accept and attend to your negative feelings. But don’t be ruled by them. This is possibly the most important thing you can learn about scary feelings; you can have them and just keep going with what you judge to be in your best interest.</li>
<li>Don’t wait for someone else to rescue you; get going on ways to take care of yourself. Focus on what you can do for yourself, and if someone else helps, be thankful for their caring, but realize that it is the delicious frosting on the cake.</li>
<li>Brainstorm for possible ways to change your situation. The first few solutions you come up with are probably a tiny fraction of what you can discover if you unleash your creativity.</li>
<li>Start with something small. Small change adds up.</li>
<li>Don’t let uncertainly stop you from acting. Move forward even though you are uncertain about whether your solution will work. Doing <strong><em>something</em></strong> at the very least gives you dignity.</li>
<li>When you are having catastrophic thoughts about yourself, ask if these thoughts are merely echoing the unsupportive words of others who spoke without looking out for your interests.</li>
<li>Focus on your <strong><em>feelings</em></strong>, attend to what you are feeling in your body. This is usually the best source of what you really need to know in order to find an answer that can help you.</li>
<li>Don’t forget to exercise, even if it is for only a few minutes per day. Exercise improves
<ul>
<li>Stress-related aspects of your physiology.</li>
<li>The positivity and clarity of your thoughts.</li>
<li>Your level of calmness.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I want to discuss life changing lessons I have learned from people who taught me how to train the mind in a way that produces improvements I and others want and maybe even desperately need.</p>
<p>The first of these people is Theodore Xenophon Barber, known by people who were connected to him as “Ted”.</p>
<p>Ted was famous for publishing many papers, I think in the hundreds of them, which are widely viewed as somehow refuting hypnosis. His studies repeatedly showed that people who were asked to pretend that they were hypnotized could perform what were generally regarded as remarkable feats <strong><em>due to</em></strong> hypnosis, even though they were merely told to act <strong><em>as if</em></strong> they were hypnotized.</p>
<p>For example, a demonstration of the powers of hypnosis was (and probably still is) to show that a small woman could, under hypnosis, carry the weight of a heavy guy who sat on her stomach when her head was on one chair and her feet on another. This was a common feat of stage hypnosis.</p>
<p>Ted showed that small people who were only told to pretend they were hypnotized could also do this kind of feat.</p>
<p>This is a good lesson about how much we underestimate our capabilities. I think we could honestly say that there is an “epidemic of self-underestimation”.</p>
<p>If you attempt to do this at home, it might or might not work. We DO massively underestimate our abilities, but we also have to activate them in the right way. For example, the person bearing the weight has to have her (or his) upper body arranged so that the shoulders, not the head are on one of the chairs.</p>
<p>We do not want to give more details that might encourage people to try this on their own. That is not a good idea. We only want to illustrate that there is a bit of finesse required for it to work. The results are remarkable, even taking the “finesse” into account.  The need to finesse the details illustrates the important point that, to use your mind effectively, you need training in the details. In this case, without being adequately trained, you might end up with a neck injury.</p>
<p>I suppose you can see why Ted was seen as a person who had refuted hypnosis. He was saying that most of us ordinary people can do what are regarded as extraordinary feats due to hypnosis.</p>
<p><span id="more-1278"></span></p>
<p>When I first met Ted, I had already read a many of his books and papers; that is why I worked to arrange for him to give some lectures and training for the faculty and students at our Department of Psychology. Since I was the faculty member who had arranged for him to come, I was charged with picking him up at the airport.</p>
<p>On the way into town, he asked me what kind of work I do.</p>
<p>I said, “I am teaching people how to use mental imagery to help them maneuver through life”.  He responded, “Oh, you are also using hypnosis.”  I responded, “No, I just use things like guided imagery”.</p>
<p>We went through several rounds of this, and he finally said, “You will understand why I am calling what you do “hypnosis” after you attend my workshop.”</p>
<p>He was right. I now see that we are all hypnotized all of the time. All of us live in a “cultural trance” that is affirmed and strengthened by others in our culture.</p>
<p>His research had not refuted hypnosis; it had shown that what has been labeled “hypnosis” is an ordinary way that we all guide our minds, whether effectively or ineffectively. Many people guide their minds to make their lives miserable and ruin their health. That same mental power could as well make them happy and healthy.</p>
<p>In Ted’s training session he gave several demonstrations. For example, he asked us to rest an elbow on the desk in front of us (It was a college classroom), and then guided us into imagining that we had received an anesthetic injection. He asked to think and imagine with him as he suggested, step by step, what would happen if we had actually been anesthetized. The large majority of people in the audience experienced what he suggested.</p>
<p>We can call this “hypnosis”, but it is a natural ability we all have and use all the time. We can suggest to ourselves that “Life sucks”, that we are “useless”, or what have you. On the other hand we can think and imagine in ways that guide us to feeling that life is good and that we can make it better and better.</p>
<p>I think I first got a sense of what Ted’s research had taught him when I took him to lunch before we went to the University. At one point the waitress asked if we wanted anything else. He answered her with a look and tone that struck me as that of an enthusiastic child and said “Can I have some more milk?”</p>
<p>He had taught himself to get real joy out of simple things in life.</p>
<p>Later, in the training workshop, he talked about working with people who wanted to quit smoking. At first he did something that is common in our “cultural trance”, being negative and punitive.</p>
<p>He had his clients think and imagine the horrible consequences of smoking. He described taking a man step by step through imagining that he had a cough that didn’t go away, that he went to a doctor who, after some tests, told him he had lung cancer. He had him imagine the subsequent steps all the way to the client’s being in a coffin lowered into his grave as his young daughter sobbed and  said, “Daddy, if only you had quit smoking!”.</p>
<p>Well, that did not work.</p>
<p>Then he described what DID work. He suggested that people who were having trouble giving up cigarettes were depressed and did not know how to savor simple pleasures in life. Then he had them imagine and think about enjoying various aspects of life. One of them was the pleasure of drinking a beverage that they really liked.</p>
<p>Hearing him mention the example of enjoying a beverage, I thought of the way he asked for “more milk”. Then I knew he was telling us how he had learned to live an exuberant life.</p>
<p>Later, I will tell you some details of what Ted had discovered about effective ways to guide the mind in ways that work for you.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In our last post we pointed out that there are “quirks” of the human mind that limit us, but also, if they are well used, can help us to be more resilient. Earlier, we had pointed out that the human mind, granted its remarkable powers, has surprisingly sharp limits on the amount of information it can process at any one time.</p>
<p>Our brains have very limited “channel capacity” or “bandwidth”. They can easily run out of resources for processing new information.</p>
<p>The silver lining of these limitations is that, if we focus on positives, we limit the space for negatives, and thus improve our critical ratio of positives to negatives. So the limitation can be turned into an advantage by filling our narrow brain “channel” with positives.</p>
<p>What else can we do to increase our positivity?</p>
<p>In this post we will explain some small shifts in how we <em>imagine</em> what we will gain by making changes in our lives that can help us to be more resilient (or, in fact, to change any of our habits).</p>
<p><span id="more-1174"></span></p>
<p>In recent years, there has been significant progress in understanding what <strong><em>kind</em></strong> of imagined actions actually lead to success. Does it really work to have fantasies about a better future?</p>
<p>Fantasy and its corollary, denial, have long been seen as ineffective ways of adapting to life. More recently, researchers have discovered new methods that make fantasies beneficial.</p>
<p>What we have to do is fantasize about what our lives would be like if we actually made the changes (e.g. modifying our diet). However, it is very important that we contrast that imagined future with the present.</p>
<p>The path to change is to imagine what our lives will be like after we change our behavior and then compare that outcome by imagining what our life is like now. The research indicates that we must do such comparisons several times.</p>
<p>I have tried this myself, and, almost like a knee-jerk reflex, it led me to a problem-solving attitude about <strong><em>how</em></strong> to make the changes. Comparing my present life to my life after changing, spontaneously led to awareness of obstacles to making the desired changes.</p>
<p>In the researchers’ own words, “Mentally contrasting a desired future with present reality standing in its way promotes commitment to feasible goals, whereas mentally indulging in a desired future does not.”</p>
<p>You can give this technique an extra boost by developing “If…Then” plans for obstacles you envision as you imagine yourself in the present. For example “If phone calls interrupt my mental contrasting sessions, I will temporarily turn off the ringer.”</p>
<p>The mental contrasting approach has been shown to result in such things as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Better <a href="http://psych.nyu.edu/oettingen/Gollwitzer,%20A.,%20Oettingen,%20G.,%20Kirby,%20T.%20A.,%20Duckworth,%20A.%20L.,%20&amp;%20Mayer,%20D.%20%282011%29.%20Motivation%20and%20Emotion.pdf">academic performance</a>.</li>
<li>Greater <a href="http://psych.nyu.edu/oettingen/Kirk,%20D.,%20Oettingen,%20G.,%20&amp;%20Gollwitzer,%20P.%20M.%20%282011%29.%20International%20Journal%20of%20Conflict%20Management.pdf">bargaining effectiveness</a>.</li>
<li>Increasing <a href="http://psych.nyu.edu/oettingen/Stadler,%20G.,%20Oettingen,%20G.%20&amp;%20Gollwitzer,%20P.%20%282009%29.%20Physical%20activity%20in%20women.pdf">physical fitness</a>.</li>
<li>Managing <a href="http://psych.nyu.edu/oettingen/Oettingen,%20G.,%20Mayer,%20D.,%20&amp;%20Brinkmann,%20B.%20%282010%29.%20Journal%20of%20Personnel%20Psychology.pdf">routine challenges</a></li>
<li>And many others.</li>
</ul>
<p>This research provides a lesson in how important it is to understand the <em>details</em> about what works to live better and what doesn’t.</p>
<p>Many recommendations about how to make positive life changes are too vague and, too often, untested.  To get the best results, you should use techniques that are specific and that also have been carefully verified.</p>
