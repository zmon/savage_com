				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This post is our second in a short series on resilient aging.</p>
<p>In our previous post on successful aging we discussed research indicating that a great deal of the physiological changes thought to be due to aging may be due to shifting toward a sedentary lifestyle.</p>
<p>Giving elderly people a program of gradually increased exercise, stretching, and relaxation can lead to physiological changes that make elders physiologically more like those of the young. Furthermore, paying young people to shift to a sedentary lifestyle leads to physiological profiles more typical of the elderly.</p>
<p>So, to a considerable degree, our biological age can be controlled by adopting the right lifestyle.</p>
<p>One of the things most of us see as inevitably linked to getting older is memory loss. Research done comparing samples of elders versus younger adults has shown that memory is typically less reliable in older people.</p>
<p>However, there are techniques that can markedly improve memory. These are techniques known since ancient times, and still used by &#8220;mnemonists&#8221;, experts who can do such things as entertain audiences by introducing themselves to each person in a sizeable audience and then accurately remembering each persons name.</p>
<p>If the old are taught these techniques, they can perform as well as or better than younger people who lack the training. This is a pattern that is not limited to memory. Training in well-selected resilience techniques can compensate for a wide range of limitations related to aging.</p>
<p>Two gerontologists, Paul and Margret Baltes developed a model of how losses due to aging can be kept under control. It is called the SOC model, for &#8220;Selection, Optimization, and Compensation&#8221;.</p>
<p>Selection refers to picking abilities that are important to us and that we are willing to work to maintain. To illustrate selection, the Baltes once used the example of the great violinist, Yehudi Menuhin who was able to perform brilliantly into his elder years, in part by reducing the number of pieces he maintained in his repertoire.</p>
<p>&#8220;Selection&#8221; is familiar to most of us, since it is basically setting your goals.</p>
<p>The &#8220;O&#8221; in SOC refers to optimization. This means developing skills or other assets that help you attain your goals.</p>
<p>Resilience training is one such means of developing widely applicable skills and habits that can move you toward the goals you chose during the selection phase. Finding a good place to exercise, or friends to join you in your exercise are other examples.</p>
<p>Compensation is illustrated by another thing that enabled Yehudi Menuhin to keep performing at the highest professional level into advanced age. After deciding which things to keep in his repertoire, he intensified his practice of the musical pieces that remained.</p>
<p>Now what if you are neither a professional musician nor a person close to old age? Well, after developing the SOC model, it was applied to young people and its results were assessed.</p>
<p>The model works for younger people too!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It&#8217;s well known that the population of the US and other Developed Countries is getting older, and this shift has many consequences.</p>
<p>A wide range of important stressors increase with age. Elderly people face many losses. Their friends and neighbors die, their appearance tends to drop below social standards for attractiveness, they typically become less agile and peppy. Eventually they often have to let go of their homes and many of their possessions; many people end up in assisted-living facilities with little beyond the things that fit into a small closet or chest.</p>
<p>This is, of course, only a tiny, hapharzardly selected, sample of stressors that tend to accompany the passage of years. Without regard to such details, the old quote from Bette Davis says it all &#8220;Getting old ain&#8217;t for sissies&#8221;. If you are smart, you will prepare for it.</p>
<p>Since it takes time and energy to develop techniques for enhancing resilience and turn them into personal habits, it is fortunate that resilience techniques are also have a myriad of benefits for dealing with any of life&#8217;s stages.</p>
<p>Several major studies have influenced our view of techniques that help us respond to aging with resilience. Our plan for this and the next few posts is to describe these influential bodies of evidence.</p>
<p>The first is based on research done by Herbert DeVries and colleagues. and summarized in a book entitled &#8220;Vigor Regained&#8221;.</p>
<p>DeVries determined &#8220;scientifically whether carefully planned and controlled exercise can help restore vigor to older people&#8221;, and solidly affirmed that it could. He found that sedentary people, even in their 70s,80s,or 90s were, after training, able to run a nonstop mile.</p>
<p><span id="more-2023"></span></p>
<p>His sedentary elders were given a slowly increasing program that started with walking at a comfortable pace, eventually punctuating the walks with short periods of jogging, which were slowly increased to full jogging.</p>
<p>Could it be that some losses thought to be due to aging are to a greater extent, due to a shortage of exercise? DeVries points out that in a previous study called &#8220;Operation Sacktime&#8221;, college-age people who had been payed to stay entirely inactive over a period of two or three weeks lost their ability to adjust to strenuous activity as indicated in measures of the reactions of heart, lungs, circulation, and muscles. Physiological indicators of fitness were like those of sedentary elders.</p>
<p>How can you make use of this information? You could get a copy of Vigor Regained. It is out of print, but we searched for it and our first hit offered a copy for less than a dollar. Try <a href="http://www.amazon.com/">Amazon</a> or <a href="http://www.abebooks.com/">Abebooks.com</a>.</p>
<p>The book is a bit technical in spots, but it isn&#8217;t necessary to focus on those details. Really, any source of information on how to develop a mild exercise program that can be slowly increased will probably do. Our main warnings are to be sure you are well enough to do the exercise before starting (ask your doctor), and avoid pushing too hard and turning it into grueling &#8220;Type A exercise&#8221;. (We see &#8220;Type A&#8217;s&#8221; at a park near our home, often many pounds overweight, running as hard as they can with dumbbells in their hands, oblivious to the harm they may be doing to themselves).</p>
<p>Make the experience positive. See if you can find a supportive friend to enjoy the experience with you.</p>
<p>Stretching was also an important part of his program. We think it&#8217;s a good idea to learn some yoga positions that provide stretching in a well-tested way. Signing up for a beginner&#8217;s yoga class is a good way to do that.</p>
<p>A third component of the program is relaxation. However, Devries did not develop a specific method of relaxation. To review some effective methods, just do a search for the term &#8220;relaxation&#8221; in this blog. Devries mentions Edmund Jacobson&#8217;s method of progressive relaxation, but does not provide a simple, self-taught way to induce deep relaxation. This is probably because he had discovered that a 15 minute brisk walk was more effective in producing relaxation than a tranquillizer.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ultimately, resilience training should result in new habits that make you more resistant to stress.</p>
<p>We have pointed out a number of times that listening to a lecture or reading an article on coping with stress is not likely to be enough to result in more resilient habits. You may get useful information, maybe even inspiration, both of which can be valuable, but that is not enough to produce new habits.</p>
<p>Usually we recommend “practice, practice, practice”. We also described “<a href="/2014/12/07/mental-contrasting-an-important-technique-for-reaching-your-goals/">mental contrasting</a>”, a method that asks you to imagine yourself as you are now, and to alternate that with imagining yourself after you have developed a new resilience habit. This differs from a widely used method of simply imagining yourself as having achieved the desired goal. The latter method has proven to be ineffective.</p>
<p>Research shows that mental contrasting improves results. For example, see Amit Amin’s paper here. Details of how to practice mental contrasting were published in the Harvard Business Review<a href="https://hbr.org/2011/02/nine-things-successful-people"> here</a>.</p>
<p>We now have the concept of the habit loop, which can act as a guide on how to develop new habits. This model of habit change contrasts with a long familiar approach of just giving yourself rewards when you engage in the behavior you want to make habitual. Instead, it focuses heavily on turning attention to the cues or triggers that elicit the behavior.<span id="more-1989"></span> </p>
<p>The power of cues is striking. We had a friend (now deceased) who never smoked in front of his parents. For a long time, he could not quit smoking. But when he visited his parents, often for long periods, he told us that he never felt an urge to smoke. The cue or cues were missing, so the urge never appeared.</p>
<p>It is important to look for the cues that trigger your behaviors because, by manipulating the cues you can control habits.</p>
<p>It is also important to develop cues to trigger habits you are trying to develop. Shawn Achor provided a very good illustration of effectively developing <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Happiness-Advantage-Principles-Psychology-Performance/dp/0307591549/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1444256134&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=the+happiness+advantage">a cue to trigger practicing on his guitar.</a></p>
<p>Achor wanted to learn to play the guitar. At first he put the guitar in a closet. He could get it out in a matter of seconds. Yet, after some time he noted that he had not practiced guitar at all! So he took it out of the closet and placed it in the living room. Then, the guitar acted as a cue for him to practice, and soon he had developed a well-cued habit.</p>
<p>Several writers who wanted to develop a steady habit of exercising have put exercise clothing next to the bed. The clothing triggers a response of dressing for the workout and then doing it.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the late 1980s, a Professor from the University of Nebraska published an <a href="http://digitalcommons.unl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1215&amp;context=psychfacpub&amp;sei-redir=1&amp;referer=http%3A%2F%2Fscholar.google.com%2Fscholar%3Fhl%3Den%26q%3Ddienstbier%2Btoughness%26btnG%3D%26as_sdt%3D1%252C26%26as_sdtp%3D#search=%22dienstbier%20toughness%22">important article</a> on something he called “toughness”. He pointed out that the prevalent belief of experts was that the “arousal” that is stimulated by stress is just plain BAD. (This word “arousal” in ordinary parlance usually refers to sex, but here it means having the brain highly activated and the body prepared for action, the kind of action that enables you to confront a threat and either escape or defeat it).</p>
<p>The Professor, Richard Dienstbier, summarized a wide range of research showing that this arousal could damage you, but could also toughen you. In some cases it can even be exhilarating and good for your health.</p>
<p>This is where the technical sense of “arousal” and the sexual sense of it converge. During sex the body responds in many of the same ways it responds to threats, for example, with fast and strong heartbeats and elevated blood pressure. It also recovers quickly and fully.</p>
<p>Quick and full recovery are at the heart of toughness and resilience.</p>
<p>If you do not recover, and have high arousal over long periods with few times at rest, THAT is damaging.</p>
<p>So if you are a person who suffers from constant distress, what can you do? Here are a few examples.</p>
<ol>
<li>Develop the Knowledge and Skills that Enable You to Recover promptly from Stress for example, learn how to <a href="/2010/12/06/a-key-step-in-resilience-training-is-learning-deep-relaxation/">relax <em>deeply</em></a><em>.</em></li>
<li>Practice some form of <a href="/2014/01/15/a-simple-way-to-sooth-and-comfort-yourself/">meditation</a>.</li>
<li>Exercise regularly, and include aerobic exercise such as brisk walking, jogging, or cycling.</li>
</ol>
<p>Just click the links and you will find instructions how to do each of the listed techniques.</p>
<p>Further Possibilities: Exposure Training</p>
<p>Dienstbier’s work focused attention on the key role of recovery from stress, but that is not all it did. It also led us to see <em>how valuable exposure to stressors could be</em>. Being exposed to stress from which you can recover promptly will make you physiologically tougher.</p>
<p>This is exactly what we do when we engage in regular exercise that is moderate.</p>
<p>We can do the same sort of thing with just about any kind of stressor. For example, most people find public speaking very stressful, and many of them join <a href="http://www.toastmasters.org/">Toastmasters</a>, where they regularly give speeches to groups of people who are also working to develop their public speaking skills.</p>
<p>Cognitive Reappraisal</p>
<p>Two things interact to produce stress reactions. First is the event itself, and second is our interpretation of the event. The interpretation can be at least as important as the event. Dienstbier makes use of a well-known model of stress reactions (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8FEMHCRowM">Lazarus and Folkman</a>). Their view is that we make two appraisals, a ”primary appraisal” and a “secondary appraisal.&#8221; Primary is an appraisal of the level of threat the stressor presents. Secondary is an appraisal of the resources you have to cope with the stressor.</p>
<p>If you judge that a stressor is beyond what you can manage, you are facing a <strong>threat</strong>. If you judge that you can handle the stressor, you are dealing with a <strong>challenge</strong>. And challenges can be opportunities to toughen yourself, and maybe even have fun.</p>
<p>Appraisals need not be set in concrete. They are, after all, in our minds. A good deal of research has been focused on teaching people to <strong>reappraise</strong> life events, and it turns out that these reappraisals can really improve performance.</p>
<p>To clarify the concept of reappraisal, imagine a student who does poorly on an important exam. The student interprets this failing as evidence that s/he is “stupid” and “hopeless”.</p>
<p>Now suppose the student is guided to consider that the failure was due to lack of skills of note taking, studying, and/or test taking. The new appraisal implies that there are things s/he can do to perform better the next time. Now a threat has been changed to a challenge.  And dealing with it can make the student tougher.</p>
<p>Cognitive reappraisal has a wide range of applications. Good research has shown that is helpful in dealing with PTSD, fighting food temptations, reducing negative feelings, and reducing anxiety. And this is very far from a complete list.</p>
<p>We will be saying more about cognitive reappraisal in future posts.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Elderly people can have devastating consequences, including death, from injuries such as breaking bones. Broken hips are hard for any of us to deal with, but often can be fatal to elders.</p>
<p>Recently research on the factors that predict recovery after falls for the elderly has shown that <a href="http://newoldage.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/11/15/predicting-a-falls-aftermath/?_php=true&amp;_type=blogs&amp;_r=0">those who were more fit before the fall were significantly more likely to recover</a>.</p>
<p>Our take on this is that elderly people who have a lifestyle that makes them more fit are more resilient in the face of mortal threats.</p>
<p>Many countries, including ours, have populations that are increasingly older. But if you take away from this recent finding that you should stay fit as you grow older, you are right, but you are, at the same time, missing the heart of the matter.</p>
<p>The main thing to take away is that the more you, whether old or yourng, cultivate your resilience, the more likely you are to come out well after any of life’s nasty challenges, and the more likely you are to recover a good life.</p>
<p>Nietszche said “Whatever does not kill me makes me stronger”.  Another, less dramatic and less poetic, way to phrase that is, if you have developed resilience skills, you are more likely to grow strong after nasty challenges instead of being taken down by them. And this is true no matter how old you are, or what kind of damage you are facing.</p>
<p>The take-home message is “start NOW to build your physical, and mental resilience”. It will help you through all the phases of your life.</p>
<p>This is YOUR LIFE we are talking about.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Some years ago we became aware of the important role of telomeres in aging, and the role of stress in speeding up the aging process. Telomeres are genetic components that are linked to biological aging. Usually, the older you are the shorter your telomeres become.</p>
<p>What did this have to do with resilience? Well, resilience controls stress, and it turns out that higher levels of stress result in increased shortening of telomeres. So your calendar age is not the only determinant of how old your cells are. Stress is a highly significant influence.</p>
<p>In fact, women who reported being highly stressed were biologically, as indexed by telomere length, about ten years older than those who did not report high stress.</p>
<p>In one of our early resilience workshops, one person in the group asked an obvious question that hadn’t occurred to us. “Is there anything that can enable us to <strong><em>lengthen</em></strong> our telomeres?&#8221; We paused, and had to say that we did not know.</p>
<p>Since that time, a good deal of research has shown that we can indeed lengthen our telomeres through lifestyle changes.</p>
<p>We were working on our usual exhaustive examination of the scientifically respectable evidence that people can lengthen their telomeres when we discovered the following interview of Dr. Dean Ornish, who recently completed a study on how the telomeres can be lengthened. We decided to re-post his video, which does a very good job of explaining what we need to do to lengthen our telomeres. We weren&#8217;t likely to improve, in a short post, on what he says in this interview. And it isn&#8217;t just a promotion of his own work; he talks about a wide range or research pointing in the same direction as his.</p>
<p><iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/QPpJU8Je-lE" frameborder="0" width="420" height="315"></iframe></p>
<p>It appears that telomeres can indeed be lengthened, and that well established healthy lifestyle changes can produce the lengthening.</p>
<p>Naturally attempts are being made to develop a kind of &#8220;Fountain of Youth&#8221; pill that can lengthen telomeres. We would recommend that such pills be viewed with great caution. It&#8217;s one thing to do things we already know are good for you and thus lengthen telomeres and quite another to take a new pill that needs lengthy testing.</p>
<p>As we have pointed out previously in this blog, the body is a highly complex, interactive ecosystem. Change one thing and many other unpredictable changes are likely to occur. The enzyme, telomerase stimulates growth of telomeres. But there is a lot of telomerase in certain malignant tumors. So who can say what kinds of side effects might result from artificial tampering?</p>
<p>On the other hand, sensible exercise, eating a healthy diet, learning to live peacefully with others, and calming ourselves through meditation have been around for centuries, and we know that their side effects improve lives</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I think it would be hard for anyone who spent even a few years probing deeply into research on stress to deny that it can really damage a person, both psychologically and physically. Reactions to stress are not just “in your head”. They are palpable.</p>
<p>Stress is far more important to health than most people think. And the more stress there is in a person’s life, the more likely it is that she or he will become ill.</p>
<p>But the load of stress people can handle without getting sick varies a lot from one person to another. What are the differences between people who are stress resistant and those who are highly vulnerable to stress? And is there some way to guide the more vulnerable people to become more stress resistant?</p>
<p>Once you shift to these questions, you are moving from an emphasis on stress to an emphasis on resilience. We made that shift several decades ago. Our approach has been to identify how resilient people deal with stress, and then to ask how more vulnerable people might learn to use those patterns of resilience.</p>
<p><span id="more-1490"></span></p>
<p>It is important to realize that stress responses are <strong><em>adaptive. </em></strong>So it is not a good idea to just try to stamp out or run away from those responses.</p>
<p>Here is an example of the adaptiveness of the stress response. You have probably heard of the “fight or flight” response. When you have that pattern of responses, your heart pounds rapidly and the little blood vessels in the outer parts of your body constrict.</p>
<p>Since your blood pressure depends on the volume of blood being pumped and the amount of resistance coming from the downstream blood vessels, your blood pressure shoots up under stress. That increases the likelihood of cardiovascular diseases such as heart attack and stroke.</p>
<p>However, the fight or flight responses also help you if you have to fight or flee. Blood flow shifts away from your intestines to your muscles, so you are better equipped for fleeing or fighting. It also shifts away from your skin and coagulates more easily, so you will lose less blood if you are wounded.</p>
<p>So whether stress responses are good or bad depends on the circumstances.</p>
<p>Also, it may be good for you to deliberately stress yourself in order to become more resilient.</p>
<p>To illustrate, it is generally believed, on the basis of much research,  both by experts and by almost everybody else, that exercise is good for you. Yet exercise is stressful, and the physiological response to exercise is identical to the fight or flight response.</p>
<p>To be healthy, exercise has to stay within a range that allows us to recover fully and promptly.</p>
<p>With regular exercise we adapt to stress. We experience a “training effect” that changes our physiology in ways that enable us to exert ourselves more and more, and yet recover without harming ourselves. Basically, exercise increases our <strong><em>resilience</em></strong>.</p>
<p>A bonus is that, once we get that training effect from physical exercise, we can even handle psychological stress more comfortably.</p>
<p>Some people are just gifted with an ability to put out more work (or take more hits) than others, and still not be permanently or seriously damaged. But virtually all of us can build up resistance to stress by gradually increasing our stress level while holding back enough that we can still recover efficiently.</p>
<p>In the older research literature on the stress of work, it was pretty clear that people were working themselves to death. In the United States our idea of a full work-week has long been 40 hours. And at least part of the weekends are commonly time off or at least paid extra “overtime” salaries. (That appears to be changing as the rift between the well off and ordinary middle class and laboring people grows).</p>
<p>In many European countries, the work week is even shorter than that.  So now instead of hearing that work kills us, we often find studies concluding that <a href="http://www.medpagetoday.com/PrimaryCare/PreventiveCare/1980"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">retirement</span> kills us</a>.</p>
<p>It was Aaron Antonovky’s book “Health, Stress, and Coping” that helped clarify for us the importance of adaptation to and prompt recovery from stress. He spoke of “Stress resistance resources”; those resources underlie our ability to adapt to greater levels of stress. They are the primary source of resilience.</p>
<p>A great deal of research on resilience has centered on psychological patterns that make us more resilient. But Antonovsky saw that as only one category of factors that make us more resilient. For example, he included cultural or communal patterns that foster healthy, happy, successful, and resilient lives.</p>
<p>He did his research in Israel, a part of the world that included people who had been deprived of even the most basic resources that might help them adapt. These were survivors of Nazi concentration camps.  Of course they had a life before the camps, and had been able to develop inner resilience.</p>
<p>By tracking down the factors that differentiated people who came out of those camps and went on to do well, often exceptionally well, he concluded that some people have resources that lead them to be resilient even when those resources are taken from them.</p>
<p>He went on to say that researchers should turn their attention away from stress and toward resilience. He came to believe that we should be looking into what keeps us well (“Salutogenisis”) instead of what makes us ill (“Pathogenesis”).</p>
<p>He maintained that stress is so common that all of us are stressed enough to get sick from it.</p>
<p>That means we should focus on the science of resilience, which is what we have done.</p>

<p>I don’t remember where I first ran into the concept of overthinking, but it appealed to me. Both Debbie and I understand the limitations of the parts of the brain that underlie thinking. We also are aware of the often unrecognized strengths of the “emotional brain”, which is commonly regarded as a giving birth to mere “fluff”.</p>
<p>Emotion is certainly not “fluff”.<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Descartes-Error-Emotion-Reason-Human/dp/014303622X/ref=sr_1_3?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1368458741&amp;sr=1-3&amp;keywords=antonio+damasio"> Antonio and Hannah Da Massio</a> have shown that we need cooperation between the emotional brain and the thinking brain in order to deal with the real world. They showed that people with brain injuries that left both their thinking and their emotional brains intact, but blocked them from cooperating with each other resulted in smart people with extremely poor judgment.</p>
<p>These people could do very well on IQ tests, and even give intelligent answers to questions like “How many giraffes are there in the United States” that require creative and complicated thinking strategies.</p>
<p>So, when I ran into several articles about overthinking, I already knew that placing too much emphasis on thinking and too little on feeling and emotions would lead to poor outcomes. So the word “overthinking” grabbed my attention.</p>
<p>The go-to book on overthinking is one called “<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Women-Who-Think-Too-Much/dp/0805075259/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1368459003&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=women+who+think+too+muchhttp://">Women Who Think Too Much</a>” by Prof. Susan Noel-Hoeksema. (Why just women? She pointed out that women are more likely than men to overthink. That is true, but actually, the few available research <a href="http://www.refocuser.com/2009/08/9-ways-to-stop-overthinking-everything/">sources</a> indicate a small, though statistically significant difference. So the book is also useful for guys).</p>
<p>As I began working my way through the book, I was impressed, and I recommended it to Debbie.</p>
<p>But, eventually I saw that reading the book is like taking a ride on a roller coaster, with the excitement and fun of learning alternating with pages of tedium. (This was my experience, not necessarily the objective truth.)</p>
<p>The best thing about the book is that it is full of methods for reducing overthinking.</p>
<p>So, here is my take:</p>
<p><span id="more-1370"></span></p>
<p>What is overthinking? Professor Noel-Hoeksema describes it as “going over and over your negative thoughts and feelings, kneading them like dough. She applies the term the “yeast effect”.  “Just as yeasty bread dough will double in size after it’s been kneaded, our negative thoughts expand, grow, and begin to take up all the space around them in our minds.”</p>
<p>We have always emphasized the damaging effects of stress amplification in limiting resilience. That last thing you should do when times are harsh is to alienate your supporters, tear yourself down, exaggerate your hopelessness… You get the idea- when you are in a distressing situation, you need someone who is on your side, but also smart about what helps and what hurts.</p>
<p>Clearly it doesn’t sound like a good thing to overthink. Research has linked it to depression. “When sadness is amplified instead of managed, it can take you down paths to hopelessness, self-hate, and immobility.”</p>
<p>It also increases anxiety, which can lead to a nasty physiological and psychological avalanche, ending in chronic arousal that “wears down the body” and eventually makes it hard for you to deal with even mildly challenging situations. All we can say is “Amen”.</p>
<p>So what can you do about overthinking? Here is a mix of examples from her book and some others that we think are also useful:</p>
<ul>
<li>Look for interpretations of distressing events that are not as damning as the ones that first come to mind.  Could nasty, critical comments about you be wrong, even silly and more about the critic than about you?</li>
<li>You should accept and attend to your negative feelings. But don’t be ruled by them. This is possibly the most important thing you can learn about scary feelings; you can have them and just keep going with what you judge to be in your best interest.</li>
<li>Don’t wait for someone else to rescue you; get going on ways to take care of yourself. Focus on what you can do for yourself, and if someone else helps, be thankful for their caring, but realize that it is the delicious frosting on the cake.</li>
<li>Brainstorm for possible ways to change your situation. The first few solutions you come up with are probably a tiny fraction of what you can discover if you unleash your creativity.</li>
<li>Start with something small. Small change adds up.</li>
<li>Don’t let uncertainly stop you from acting. Move forward even though you are uncertain about whether your solution will work. Doing <strong><em>something</em></strong> at the very least gives you dignity.</li>
<li>When you are having catastrophic thoughts about yourself, ask if these thoughts are merely echoing the unsupportive words of others who spoke without looking out for your interests.</li>
<li>Focus on your <strong><em>feelings</em></strong>, attend to what you are feeling in your body. This is usually the best source of what you really need to know in order to find an answer that can help you.</li>
<li>Don’t forget to exercise, even if it is for only a few minutes per day. Exercise improves
<ul>
<li>Stress-related aspects of your physiology.</li>
<li>The positivity and clarity of your thoughts.</li>
<li>Your level of calmness.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Our last two posts focused on research showing that there are two variants of a gene that result in your having either a “worrier brain” or a “warrior brain”. However, the research also shows that a “worrier” can function like a “warrior” with the right kind of training. Extensively exposing worriers to simulations of the stressors they need to face enabled many of them to deal with stress as effectively as warriors.</p>
<p>This “<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exposure_therapy">exposure training</a>” has been used widely by psychotherapists, and its efficacy is well established.</p>
<p>A second approach that improves performance under stress is “reappraisal”. An excellent example of reappraisal is teaching people about the helpful effects of our bodily stress responses. For example, blood glucose can be increased due to stress, and that can help when facing challenges like taking tests. Again, this is not new to psychotherapists; commonly they point out that what a person is experiencing as fear or anxiety can also be seen as “excitement”. This kind of shift in perspective has been shown to work.</p>
<p>In this post we want to point out some other things that both of us feel are particularly useful in dealing with stress.</p>
<p><span id="more-1359"></span></p>
<p>Debbie and I agreed to identify which methods we would add to the two described in the previous two posts. Debbie’s list was the best, so here is a summary of it.</p>
<ul>
<li>Exercise: Just about everyone these days knows about the body’s natural opiates that counter stress and even reduce pain. Exercise also produces <a href="/2012/05/09/physical-exercise-is-a-surefire-way-to-de-stress/">other, less well known, chemical changes</a> that are calming. Debbie also points out that exercise helps to shift our thoughts toward the positive.</li>
<li>Challenging negative thoughts, which commonly do you no good, and finding more useful, positive thoughts.</li>
<li>Practice being in the present moment rather than always anticipating and maybe even overthinking about possible bad things in the future.</li>
<li>Shift to a more positive frame by keeping a daily log of things that went well, and try to notice for a particular time period (e.g. a day), the things you like about other people.</li>
<li>One of the weaknesses of self-help is that most of us find it hard to do what we know is in our best interests. Debbie suggests “<a href="/2012/10/17/finding-a-path-to-a-more-resilient-life-the-devil-is-in-the-details/">Mental Contrasting</a>”, which has been shown to help people follow through on their good intentions. Mentally contrasting a future you want with present reality energizes us and encourages us to commit to the actions that will get us to our goal.</li>
</ul>
<p>The only thing I want to add to that list is controlled regulation of breathing. Details of how to do that are in <a href="/2011/12/14/dont-let-overwhelming-distress-take-you-down/">this post</a> and <a href="/2011/06/14/a-plain-vanilla-application-of-tactical-breathing-to-increase-resilience/">this one</a>.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This may appear to be a preposterous claim, but there is good reason to believe that, through building your resilience, you can slow your body’s rate of cellular aging, and also that, regardless of your cellular age, you can match the functional level of young people if you have good resilience skills.</p>
<h3><strong>“Illusory Aging”</strong></h3>
<p>I frequently hear my friends complain about loss of memory, being tired, or lacking energy, which they attribute to aging. I am convinced that many of the symptoms they attribute to age are really due to a lack of exercise, or to making unreasonable demands on the brain in an era of information overload. Usually this kind of “aging” can be dealt with moderate exercise and easing up on the demands we make on our brains, e.g. quieting the mind through meditation. We could as well say it can be dealt with by reducing stress and improving our resilience skills.</p>
<h3><strong>Real Aging and What You Can Do About It.</strong></h3>
<p>Of course, there is also real aging, even down to the cellular level. For example, there are little end caps on chromosomes, called telomeres. Telomeres shorten each time a cell divides, and therefore they are an index of biological aging. There is clearly nothing illusory about that kind of aging.</p>
<p>In fact, in a <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC534658/?rendertype=abstract">study</a> by Elissa Epel and her colleagues, women who reported being highly stressed had telomere lengths that indicated ten more years of aging than the telomeres of less stressed women.</p>
<p><span id="more-1302"></span></p>
<p>Interestingly, the same tactics we use to deal with illusory aging appear to provide our best hope of slowing biological aging. There is <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/01/28/AR2008012801873.html">research</a> showing that the telomeres of people who exercise shorten more slowly those who exercise less.</p>
<p>The levels of exercise in this study were moderate, with the high end at about three hours of exercise per week. Don’t make the mistake of thinking that, no matter how lengthy and intense, exercise is healthy. Robert Sapolsky pointed out that salmon swim upstream, against the current, leaping over waterfalls and dams, in order to spawn. Their bodies undergo <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=4_K7Bvxy0AIC&amp;pg=PA127&amp;lpg=PA127&amp;dq=robert+sapolsky+aging+salmon&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=C6vzS4xqeL&amp;sig=QBnjY5VjVGfuAjnng100Ans233M&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=wGT_UNKtHILsqwHxioCYCg&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CFsQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&amp;q=robert%20sapolsky%20aging%20salmon&amp;f=false">very rapid and severe aging</a> at that time, and they die.</p>
<p>It has been shown that removal of the adrenal glands, which secrete stress hormones, prevents this rapid aging. In addition, Sapolsky points out that well known effects of stress hormones correspond to symptoms of aging: fatigue, thinning muscles, adult-onset diabetes, hypertension, osteoporosis, reproductive decline, and immune suppression.</p>
<p>Decades ago, long before we knew anything about telomeres, <a href="http://www.abebooks.com/servlet/SearchResults?an=herbert+devries&amp;sts=t&amp;tn=vigor+regained">Herbert De Vries</a> did research showing that old, sedentary people could improve their physiological markers of aging by going on a gradually increasing program of exercise (e.g. walking with a very slow increase to jogging).</p>
<p>In contrast, he found that college students paid for being inactive began to show physiological signs of aging.</p>
<h3><strong>What to Do If You Have Already Declined Functionally.</strong></h3>
<p>Now what if you haven’t been able to prevent manifestations of aging. As a result, maybe you have become forgetful, or seen significant losses of ability that are usually linked with increased age. Is there anything you can do about that?</p>
<p>The answer is “Yes”.</p>
<p>A <a href="http://library.mpib-berlin.mpg.de/ft/ul/UL_Limits_2001.pdf">major long-term study</a> of people ranging from 70 to over 100 years old showed us how others have done that.</p>
<p>Here is the pattern of tactics that work:</p>
<p><strong>Selection</strong>: Realize that your capacity is diminished, and that you have to reduce your range of activities. You have to pick what you value the most and really want to maintain. A good example is the great violinist, Yehudi Menuhin, who continued his outstanding performances into advanced old age.</p>
<p><strong><em>How did he do that?</em></strong> He began by reducing his repertoire(selection), so he had less to maintain.</p>
<p><strong>Optimization</strong>: Search for the <strong><em>most effective ways</em></strong> for maintaining the quality of the activities you have chosen to retain. Menuhin focused his energy on the smaller repertoire of musical pieces he wanted to perform.</p>
<p><strong>Compensation</strong>: <strong><em>Put into practice the effective methods</em></strong> you find. Menuhin intensified his practice of the music he had chosen.</p>
