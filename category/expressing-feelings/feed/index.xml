				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Should you do all in your power to block every negative thought from coming into your mind? Some people have argued that <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Cant-Afford-Luxury-Negative-Thought/dp/0931580242/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1420479276&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=you+can%27t+afford+the+luxury+of+a+negative+thought">you cannot afford the luxury of a negative thought</a>.</p>
<p>A common refrain in our society is “Be positive!” And there is a great deal of research supporting the idea that <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Positivity-Top-Notch-Research-Reveals-Change/dp/0307393747/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1420479383&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=positivity+barbara+fredrickson">positivity is good for you</a>. But can you really turn your mind from negative to positive on demand? Does that really help?</p>
<p><a href="http://www.abebooks.com/servlet/BookDetailsPL?bi=14729916967&amp;searchurl=x%3D64%26y%3D4%26bi%3D0%26ds%3D30%26sts%3Dt%26bx%3Doff%26sortby%3D17%26tn%3Dthe+nature+of+emotion%26an%3Dpaul+ekman%26recentlyadded%3Dall">Convincing research</a> indicates that pretending we are not distressed when we really are results in physiological responses that are known to be unhealthy, e.g. high blood pressure. This doesn’t happen if we <a href="http://www.utexas.edu/features/archive/2005/writing.html">get to think and talk about our feelings of distress</a>, which inevitably involves letting negative thoughts and feelings enter your mind.</p>
<p>More than a few highly competent researchers have argued that there are actually benefits to negativity.</p>
<p><span id="more-1815"></span></p>
<p>One of them, <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2014/09/dont-think-positively/379993/">Dr. Julie Norem</a>, maintains that many of us do well by using a strategy of “defensive pessimism”. This means that, when we set a goal, we go on to review all the things that might go wrong, then develop ways of preventing the anticipated problems from blocking our success.</p>
<p>To us, that strategy is just common sense, but we would not have thought of it as pessimism.</p>
<p>In the famous <a href="http://www.abebooks.com/servlet/SearchResults?an=george+vaillant&amp;sts=t&amp;tn=adaptation+to+life">Harvard Grant Study</a>, participants were tested and interviewed regularly over their lifetime.  <em>Anticipation</em>, a tendency to look ahead for problems and avoid being blind-sided by them was identified as a healthy way to live. Anticipation is one of the “healthy defense mechanisms” identified in that study. And it seems to be “defensive pessimism” by another name.</p>
<p>It’s not clear to us why that kind of behavior should be categorized as negative and labeled “defensive pessimism”. It could as well be deemed a way to deal with reality and prepare for problems we are likely to confront. It is more like “realism” than “pessimism”.</p>
<p>It also seems to us that defensive pessimism implies that you are hopeful enough to look for solutions that can get you to your goal. That’s a pretty positive attitude, very different from something like “It’s no use. There is nothing I can do to succeed in this situation”, which is clearly negative. See this <a href="/2011/08/09/handling-distress-the-power-of-optimism-hope-and-a-problem-solving-attitude/">earlier post</a> for an interesting case of shifting a person from hopeless pessimism to problem solving.</p>
<p>In our research on resilience, we found that optimism is linked to a “problem solving attitude”, which seems to be exactly what defensive pessimists have.</p>
<p>However, it doesn’t matter what you call it; anticipating problems and finding solutions to them is a good way to deal effectivly with life’s challenges.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Up until now we have discussed the value of expressing emotions when you are distressed. When you become clear about your feelings and safely express them, it has a calming effect. Expressiveness is a wonderful tool for self-soothing.</p>
<p>Do the opposite effects occur when suppressing positive emotions?</p>
<p>You may think, “Why would anyone suppress positive emotions?”</p>
<p>It’s actually not unusual. Think of a saying like “Pride goeth before a fall”. There is a tendency to believe that you will be punished if you are too joyful.</p>
<p>Many people learn as they grow up to keep a stony look on their face. It’s just what serious, hardworking people do.</p>
<p>Also, when learning to suppress negative feelings, the suppression can easily spread to all feelings.</p>
<p>I just googled the phrase “keep a straight face”, and there were many entries, most of them on <em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">learning how</span></em> to keep a straight face. So it seems that people are looking for ways to suppress their feelings.</p>
<p>I could give many more examples showing how deep our fear of expressing joy is. But this is enough to show that studying the effects of suppressing positive feelings is a worthwhile enterprise.</p>
<p>In this post I want to describe some exceptionally well-designed research that revealed the physiological impact of suppressing positive and negative emotions.</p>
<p><span id="more-1456"></span></p>
<p>What I have to say here is based on elegant research done by James Gross and Robert Levenson, and published in two papers.</p>
<p><a title="The first of the papers" href="http://ist-socrates.berkeley.edu/~ucbpl/docs/48-Emotion%20Elicitation95.pdf">The first of the papers</a> described how they developed effective methods of producing authentic emotions in the laboratory. They edited sections of videos that seemed capable of producing emotions. And then they went on to test whether their selections actually worked. Two good examples are the “faking orgasm” scene in “When Harry Met Sally” (to produce amusement) and actual footage of the surgical removal of a human arm (to produce disgust).</p>
<p>They spent years developing and testing these videos, and the videos worked well and better than previous methods.</p>
<p>In <a title="the second paper" href="http://ist-socrates.berkeley.edu/~ucbpl/docs/51-Hiding%20Feelings97.pdf">the second paper</a>, they tested, among many other things, whether suppression of both positive and negative emotions elicited increases in physiological activity that correspond to the well known stress response of fight or flight.</p>
<p>That kind of reaction includes faster heart rate, sweaty hands, faster breathing and a wide range of other bodily responses that are useful for surviving when confronted with a lethal threat, but damaging when you experience them regularly at work, at home, or in any place that is part of your everyday life.</p>
<p>Their conclusion was clear: suppression of either kind of emotion elicits a fight or flight response.</p>
<p>So it would seem to be wise to avoid a life in which you are regularly or even constantly needing to suppress your feelings.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For people who are new to this blog, we have been reviewing the three core factors that underlie resilience. Probably some of the original readers have forgotten those factors, so this review may be useful to them too.</p>
<p>In the previous two posts we described the first two factors. Here we deal with the third and final factor. This factor has to do with expressing or articulating your inner reactions to distressing situations.</p>
<p>James Pennebaker and his colleagues did a series of studies that linked expressiveness to improved physical and mental health. This work was summarized in Pennebaker’s book “<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Opening-Up-Healing-Expressing-Emotions/dp/1572302380/ref=sr_1_2?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1374426455&amp;sr=1-2&amp;keywords=james+pennebaker">Opening Up: The Healing Power of Confiding in Others</a>”. Basically, they showed that clarifying and speaking of your feelings about things that distress you led to improved mental and even physical health.</p>
<p>It is easy to confuse the self-expression Pennebaker and his colleagues advocate with other actions that can even be damaging, so we will clarify the details of how to be expressive.</p>
<h4><strong>What You Need to Do to Improve Your Self-Understanding and To Express It.</strong></h4>
<p><span id="more-1423"></span></p>
<p>To articulate your reactions, the first step is to understand them. You can, most likely, improve your understanding of your own reactions by way of inner dialogue. But there are advantages to having someone else also understand you.</p>
<p>Effective communication often happens in psychotherapy, but it also can take place in serious conversations with caring friends and other people who are good listeners, patient, and willing to let you know when they don’t understand.</p>
<p>If you have the right kind of listener, you might also have a dialogue that improves both their and your understanding of how you feel and why you feel as you do. It requires you to be very clear about your feelings because it is very hard to explain them in a way that effectively communicates them to others.</p>
<p>Both self-understanding and self-expression are of remarkable value in helping you keep in check what might otherwise be a damaging stress reaction.</p>
<h4><strong>Journaling</strong></h4>
<p>Though there is a clear advantage to effectively sharing your deep feelings with supportive friends, such sharing is not always easy or even possible.</p>
<p>In such cases, <a href="http://homepage.psy.utexas.edu/homepage/faculty/pennebaker/home2000/WritingandHealth.html">writing down how you have reacted to a troubling situation</a>, even without an outside listener, can be helpful. Studies have shown that writing a journal that focuses on expressing how you feel about hurtful experiences diminishes their negative consequences.</p>
<p>The following video has the founder of this journaling method showing how it is done:<br />
<iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/XsHIV9PxAV4?rel=0" frameborder="0" width="640" height="360"></iframe></p>
<h4><strong>A Special Kind of Focusing</strong></h4>
<p>Another method of clarifying feelings is through a process called Focusing. Privately talking to yourself about how you feel can be worth a lot. However, you have to focus in a specific way, emphasizing how you feel, and paying attention to your body’s reactions as you go through this inner dialogue.</p>
<p>The special kind of <a href="/2011/05/13/relieve-distress-with-extra-ordinary-focusing/">focusing</a> developed by Eugene Gendlin is an outstanding way to learn from those bodily reactions. This special kind of focusing is not easy to explain, and we think that <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Power-Focusing-Practical-Emotional-Self-Healing/dp/157224044X/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1374042330&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=ann+cornell+weiser">Ann Cornell Weiser</a> has done the best job we have seen in explaining how to focus.</p>
<p>We often think that just keeping quiet about our feelings and ignoring them can make them irrelevant to our mental and physiological functions. James Lynch has shown clearly that emotions that cannot be formulated in our mind enough to be spoken or written tend to be expressed in harmful physiological reactions, for example, in elevated blood pressure.</p>
<p>Lynch’s work is not as well known as it should be. If his books are not available in your library, you could get them on <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Language-Heart-Bodys-Response-Dialogue/dp/046503795X/ref=sr_1_5?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1374042815&amp;sr=1-5&amp;keywords=James+Lynch">Amazon</a>, but as of this writing they are available on <a href="http://www.abebooks.com/servlet/SearchResults?an=James+Lynch&amp;sts=t&amp;tn=The+language+of+the+heart">Abebooks</a> for as little as $1.00 plus a few dollars in shipping fees.</p>
<p>He did extensive research on people who did not respond well to medicines in reducing dangerously high blood pressure. He concluded that they were often expressing their emotions by way of these elevations of blood pressure.</p>
<p>Learning to understand our reactions and express them in words instead of bodily reactions helps us be more resilient. This is not the same as “<a href="/2011/04/18/articulation-of-feelings-is-not-the-same-as-venting/">getting our anger out</a>”.  That is more likely to be damaging than helpful.</p>
<p>Learning to understand what you really feel about what is going in your life is healthy but take care that you express those feeling in situations that do not unnecessarily trigger hostile reactions in others.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>What should we do with anger bottled up inside of us? A <a href="http://articles.washingtonpost.com/2013-05-20/national/39387984_1_heart-attack-elizabeth-mostofsky-risk">recent article in the Washington Post</a> discussed a serious effect of one option, that of letting out the raw anger, even to the point of throwing things and threatening to hurt other people.</p>
<p>A common theme for some mental health professionals has been that we should get the anger out. For these therapists, sessions can consist of banging a pillow (usually representing  parents who were taken as having failed the client), with a bat that has many of the properties of a nasty club, but is in fact safely padded.</p>
<p>The Washington Post article describes a study in which about 4000 people who had heart attacks were asked about their experiences of anger. Heart attacks were twice as likely to occur after an episode of anger. There was a tendency for the heart attacks to occur within two hours of the anger episode.</p>
<p>Patients were also asked to rate how intense their anger episode had been, and the more intense the anger episode, the more likely patients were to have a heart attack.</p>
<p>So we have therapists trying to help us get the anger out versus research showing that expressing anger can lead to a heart attack.  So what are we to do? Should we bottled up our anger or express it?</p>
<p><span id="more-1382"></span></p>
<p>The Washington Post article says that “Bottling up of emotions is thought to harm both mind and body, but a new study suggests that doing the opposite may be no better.” What I want to do here is to be sure readers don’t take the options as limited to either “bottling up” or “doing the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">opposite</span>”, blowing your stack.</p>
<p>There is a lot of research indicating that, even though <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Anger-Misunderstood-Emotion-Carol-Tavris/dp/0671675230/ref=sr_1_3?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1369798270&amp;sr=1-3&amp;keywords=carol+tavris">letting out raw anger</a> harms you, striving to get clear about, articulate, and express your emotions has positive effects on the mind and body, not to mention on social relationships.</p>
<p>This is very different from blowing your stack or “<a href="/2011/04/18/articulation-of-feelings-is-not-the-same-as-venting/">venting</a>”, which has long been known to be an ineffective and typically damaging way to deal with distressing experiences.</p>
<p>It is important to learn how to <a href="/2011/05/03/focusing-a-highly-effective-way-to-resolve-distress/">understand your feelings when distressed</a>, and to articulate them without unnecessarily alienating others, especially others who might be able to help you minimize any potential damage coming from your stress. “Blowing your stack” is almost certain to amplify the impact of stress.</p>
<p>With stress amplification, your response to stress increases the physiological responses that make heart attacks more likely. That kind of response also may alienate your potential support systems and thus make   you less resilient and more vulnerable. It’s amazing how many people follow this totally ineffective pattern of stress management.</p>
<p>Your anger is there to protect you. It helps you to push against obstacles that can block you from reaching your goals, including people who are trying to dominate you in order to reach their own goals.</p>
<p>If you use anger well, it will be a powerful source of energy to help you reach your goals.</p>
<p>If, instead, you amplify the impact of your stress, you become your own enemy, often your own worst enemy.</p>
<p>To deal with anger you should not act on it. Don’t let your brain’s motor system rule you. You should attend to the anger and find out what it means.</p>
<p>To do this, you have to <a title="open a mental space in which you can gain a deep understanding of why you are angry" href="/2011/05/03/focusing-a-highly-effective-way-to-resolve-distress/">open a mental space in which you can gain a deep understanding of why you are angry</a>.</p>
<p>That way you are more likely to move toward your sensible goals instead of undermining yourself.</p>
<p>You should take time to attend to your angry reactions, focusing first on what you feel in your body.  Visit with those bodily reactions until they can be expressed in words.</p>
<p>When you do that, you shift from unwise, primitive commands from the parts of your brain that lead to mindless action. Instead you pull together and synthesize thoughts with emotions and then take action.</p>
<p>That synthesis is most likely to be the creative source of actions that are both wise and effective.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One test of the usefulness of our program and techniques is whether we really practice what we preach. We are not perfect models of what we believe in, nor are we people of super-resilience. I think in an earlier post I acknowledged that my life was far from handing me a cornucopia of resilience skills, and I think I am safe in saying that would also be true for Debbie.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, there were things in our early experiences that helped us develop a fighting spirit and a sense that we can improve by learning what we need to do and doggedly putting what we learned into practice.</p>
<p>For some months we have been dealing with extremely stressful situations. I cannot be explicit about them because that would violate the privacy of others, including others that we care deeply about. I think it’s okay if I say that it involves the approaching death of someone who has been important part of our lives. This is aggravated by dementia of a beloved member of our family, and intense pressure put on even the tiniest of fractures between members of the extended family.</p>
<p>So what has helped us to deal with these things?</p>
<p><span id="more-971"></span></p>
<p>We have both increased our use of deep relaxation. We listen to one of the short audio recordings we designed ourselves, narrated by Debbie. These take only 10-20 minutes.</p>
<p>Even fitting this into our pressured schedules can be hard, but it is well worth the effort. These sessions take us to a level of relaxation that drastically reduces our stress responses.</p>
<p>In spite of there being a lot of interference with sticking to exercise regimens, we both have continued to exercise. Exercise reduces stress reactions in many ways; it reduces stress enhancing bodily chemicals and increases natural bodily chemicals that calm and sooth us.</p>
<p>One of our ways of exercising is to hike in wooded areas which we are fortunate to have tucked away even in our metropolitan area. We usually take our dog, Luke, and his intense enjoyment of being off leash in a place full of surprises and fascinating odors, helps us to experience the joys of being in nature.</p>
<p>Speaking of our dog, he shows clear signs of feeling our distressing experiences very deeply. Dogs, and many other animals, are geniuses at sensing distress in members of their “pack”. So we decided to have what (I blush to admit this) we have dubbed “lovey-dovey time”, just before bed time. He quickly learned that when we say “It’s lovey-dovey time”, both of us are going to lie down beside him and massage and pet him for a while. He, who is normally a very rough and tumble dog, becomes soft and gentle during those sessions.</p>
<p>Research shows that when you pet an animal, the animal’s heart rate and blood pressure go down, and so does yours. Debbie and I both have marveled at how much better we feel during and after these sessions. We had read about it in research studies, but experiencing it is something else.</p>
<p>Debbie and I have an understanding that we’ve got each other’s backs, and that is a core purpose in our lives.</p>
<p>In our last post, we discussed the positive impact of emotional support at home. We have extended that beyond home.</p>
<ul>
<li>Every night we go through a debriefing between the two of us, thus augmenting each other’s individual perspective.</li>
<li>We have extended this theme of support to the extended family by planning coping strategies as a group, with everyone’s viewpoint getting a hearing.</li>
<li>We have steadily worked to create a store of past experiences of support and trust throughout the extended family, so we can speak more frankly with each other than would otherwise be possible.</li>
<li>Whenever possible we have been cooperative with family members who might have reason to oppose us.</li>
</ul>
<p>We still have to take hits; our phone rings over and over again, often making it impossible to relax at night. That is one of the costs incurred by being positive and constructive with all of the people who have a stake in this. Because we have developed our means of individual support and support of each other, we can afford these intrusions, even though they add to our stress load.</p>

For years many in the mental health field have encouraged people to blow off steam, let out their anger, and get things off their chest. It was a model that implied that, when we are upset, we are like a boiler that is overheated, and that will blow up if it does not release some of the pressure. But humans are much more complex than boilers. <a href="/2011/04/18/articulation-of-feelings-is-not-the-same-as-venting/">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&#8594;</span></a>]]></description>

<p>For years many in the mental health field have encouraged people to blow off steam, let out their anger, and get things off their chest. It was a model that implied that, when we are upset, we are like a boiler that is overheated, and that will blow up if it does not release some of the pressure. But humans are much more complex than boilers.</p>
<p>This way of handling distress, which is called “venting”, is <strong><em>not</em></strong> likely to make you feel better or become healthier.</p>
<p>Carol Tavris and Elliot Aronson gave a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Mistakes-Were-Made-But-Not/dp/0156033909/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1303097019&amp;sr=1-1">nice, concise summary of the effects of venting:</a></p>
<p>“…when people vent they often feel worse, pump up their blood pressure, and make themselves even angrier. Venting is especially likely to backfire if a person commits an aggressive act against another person directly…”.</p>
<p>There are commonly social ramifications of venting. Venting or dumping strong negative feelings on other people is likely to lead to reactions on their part that will create more stress. People have a way of making a person who is venting and dumping on them pay a price for doing so. And so the original stress gets amplified instead of being brought under control.</p>
<p>More careful therapists were likely to have people “get their anger out” by having them do things like yelling and screaming at pillows or beating on them with bats wrapped in foam rubber. This avoids antagonizing others and thereby amplifying stress.</p>
<p>However, if you don’t have a deep inner connection to your words and actions, these methods are not likely to resolve the issues. This pounding and yelling is probably, at best, a way to get a bit of exercise.</p>
<p>Fully articulating feelings tends to produce healthy outcomes, e.g. <a href="../2011/04/13/control-distress-by-understanding-and-expressing-yourself/">fewer physical symptoms</a>, <a href="http://homepage.psy.utexas.edu/homepage/faculty/pennebaker/reprints/Kiecolt.pdf">fewer visits to health care facilities, and improved immunity</a>. This articulating, unlike venting, involves a serious look at what has you upset and how you feel about it. You should come away from the experience with a sense of greater self-understanding and of relief.</p>
<p>The following are some clues that you are engaging in unproductive venting:</p>
<ul>
<li>When you vent, you do not      feel a sense of progressing toward recovery; you can go over and over the      problem without moving forward at all.</li>
<li>Your inner tension is      likely to improve little if at all, and often will rise.</li>
<li>You don’t get a feeling of      deepening your understanding of yourself and why you are reacting as you      are.</li>
<li>You don’t get a glimmer of      how you might proceed to improve the situation or live well in spite of      it.</li>
<li>Commonly the focus is on      others, on how awful and wicked they are.</li>
</ul>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In this post, I want to discuss the third factor we <a href="../../../../../2011/01/11/the-three-core-factors-that-can-make-you-more-resilient/">identified in our research on personal resilience</a>. It involves two things:</p>
<ul>
<li>Attending to and clarifying      your feelings about distressing experiences.</li>
<li>Expressing those clarified      feelings in a safe way that enables you to feel clearer and better about      them.</li>
</ul>
<p>As with the other two factors, this one has been the object of much research. <a href="http://homepage.psy.utexas.edu/homepage/faculty/pennebaker/Reprints/index.htm">James Pennebaker</a> was the researcher who first identified it as important. He and his  co-workers found that women who reported having been sexually abused  also reported, later in life, a markedly elevated number of symptoms of  ill health. However, if they had opportunities to <strong><em>express</em></strong> their feelings about the experience, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Opening-Up-Healing-Expressing-Emotions/dp/1572302380/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1302704279&amp;sr=1-1">the symptoms were markedly diminished</a>.</p>
<p>There is good research that supports the idea that expressing feelings reduces bodily responses to stress. For example, <a href="http://ist-socrates.berkeley.edu/%7Eucbpl/docs/51-Hiding%20Feelings97.pdf">Robert Levenson</a> found that people who participated in an experiment in which they were  required to watch a gruesome video of the amputation of a human limb had  stronger physiological reactions to the experience if they were also  asked to <strong><em>hide</em></strong> those reactions. (The video was gruesome enough that even those told to conceal their reactions were not fully able to comply.)</p>
<p>This  and similar research indicates that it is a healthy thing to spend the  time and effort to understand your feelings and to find a way to  articulate them.</p>
<p>A very good method is to talk to a well-trusted  friend. Of course, that kind of friend is often not available. Be  careful about expressing your private reactions to people who are not  solidly on your side. Instead of helping, it can make things worse,  amplify stress, and turn a small problem into a big one.</p>
<p>Fortunately, research shows us that <strong><em><a href="http://homepage.psy.utexas.edu/HomePage/Faculty/Pennebaker/Reprints/P1997.pdf">journaling privately to articulate how you feel about bad experiences also works</a></em></strong>. If you are in doubt about the supportiveness of potential listeners, it might be wise to use journaling.</p>
<p>In either case, focus on how you <strong><em>feel</em></strong> about the distressing situation. Do not worry about your style,  grammar, etc. Clarifying what you feel is the crux of the matter.</p>
<p>Later we will have more to say about how to <strong><em>listen to yourself</em></strong> enough to clarify your feelings about bad situations.</p>
