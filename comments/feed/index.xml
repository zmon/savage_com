		<description><![CDATA[Excellent question! 
Debbie and I have been inundated by barriers to keeping the pace, e.g. Deb &#039;s being the primary person managing her mother, who is at late stages of Alzheimer&#039;s disease. Maybe we should write some posts on that. The research out there shows that caretakers of people with Alzheimer&#039;s take a real blast at their immune system, and it goes on long after the the patient dies.

In my case, it is harder to come up with new ideas when you have been writing them for so long. I do extensive reviews of the material after the blog post has been written, and many edits bounced back and forth between the two of us.

Finally we were hit by a problem that made us unable to log on to our site and I spent over a month working with our provider to find a solution. After climbing up abut six levels to the peak of tech support at our provider, they had no useful answers. So I had to find work-a rounds. So farbtheynare all cumbersome and slow.

That&#039;s probably more than you were asking for, but it&#039;s actually abbreviated.

It has provided incentives for keeping up with our own resilience practices. We have to keep that in mind.

		<description><![CDATA[This is delightful, thank you. I heard once &quot;If you want to enjoy old age, start early.&quot; I&#039;ve also seen a study recommending setting up patterns of behavior by your 50s because after that it&#039;s much harder to do. It&#039;s good to have information like this so you can establish patterns that make that stage of life an enjoyable one.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Can you get an audio set up to guide you through the breathing method with the correct? I have used audios many times for myself, and also have tried using audios in presenting resilience training programs. The audios seem to work as well as having someone present to guide the procedure.

Congratulations for being gritty enough to use the powers of your mind to find a way to greater functional capability.

		<description><![CDATA[The articles in this blog are not short forms of previous articles. The closest we can come to more detail on material covered by the blog posts is in a book we have been preparing for some years. The draft we have is not yet ready for distribution. We will definitely call it to the attention of readers when it is ready.

In each post we provide guides to related publication. We put a good deal of effort into identifying suitable articles and books.
