Thank you for your kind comment. When we decided to start this blog, I thought it would be much more interactive, including helpful tips from us and other readers. instead we were flooded with spam. Temporarily we had to shut down comments. I think we have that problem solved now.

I really appreciate your comment. The central purpose of the blog is to make a difference in the lives of readers, and hearing from people like you is encouraging.

Best wishes,

Jerry Sheridan]]></description>

 Your site has been beneficial for me several times.  I have given this address to many of my friends and they like it also.  Thank you for your thorough and well I cannot think of the word right now, ease to read and understand, posts.  The availability to past posts is also great.

Sincerely,
