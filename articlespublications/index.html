<h2 id="1">Action Plan For Improving Personal Resilience</h2>
<h3>Deborah Snow Sheridan, published in KC Jewish Chronicle, September 2006,  under the title of &#8220;Managing Your Stress&#8221;</h3>
<p>Most of you are aware of stress programs that provide good information but have no impact because you never get around to implementing the ideas presented. This articleâ€™s aim is to assist you in developing an action plan that will have an impact on your resilience level. Keep in mind that it is best to try to make no more that a few modest changes in your behavior at one time. Deep relaxation is the example of an anti-stress routine to include in your personal resilience plan.</p>
<h2 id="2">Good Medicine For Aging.</h2>
<h3>Deborah Snow Sheridan, Published in KC Jewish Chronicle, June 2006</h3>
<p>This is the second article in a series about what we can do to make ourselves  more resilient. With baby boomers reaching their senior years there is a push to discover  ways to delay serious illness and remain youthful and vigorous. We can minimize the impact of  natural losses in cognitive functioning,social support, and physical vigor by following  three key strategies as described by noted gerontologists Paul and Marget Baltes.</p>
<h2 id="3">Resilience:The Stress Antidote</h2>
<h3>Deborah Snow Sheridan, Published in KC Jewish Chronicle Under the Title &#8220;Dealing With Stress&#8221;, February 2006</h3>
<p>There has been a dramatic shift in our understanding of stress and how to deal  with it. Most recent research has shown that there are three key ways to stay resilient:  1.Staying positive and learning to calm ourselves, 2.Not over-reacting or being unreasonably self-critical, and 3. Articulating and expressing our distress. Small changes in behaviors to replenish  ourselves can make a big difference. Look in this article for proven suggestions.</p>
<h2 id="4">Making Exercise a Priority</h2>
<h3>Deborah Snow Sheridan, Published in KC Jewish Chronicle, November 2005</h3>
<p>Most of us have been told of the benefits of regular exercise. Among other things, exercise can greatly enhance resilience. This article  reminds you of the many benefits, but the core purpose is to give you some suggestions on  how to make exercise a habit that endures year round.</p>
<h2 id="5">Stress Vulnerability And Return To Work In Chronic Pain Patients</h2>
<h3>Sheridan, Deborah, Nelson, Jake, Sheridan, Charles,<br>
Presented at the annual meeting of the American Psychological Association, 2000</h3>
<p>This was a presentation summarizing the results of a research study conducted in a chronic pain center. There are  85 million chronic pain sufferers in the United States and over half are partially to totally disabled. It assessed the role of depression and resilience prior to treatment in a multidisciplinary pain treatment program. Patients were given brief psychological tests just prior to starting treatment. It was already well known that depression influences recovery from chronic pain, but resilience had not been studied. The end point of interest was whether patients had returned to work after completing the program. Six weeks post treatment, both depression and the resilience measure proved to be significant predictors of return to work. As expected, depression was a significant predictor of the outcome, but when the resilience measure was added, the two in combination were powerful predictors of successful outcome.</p>
<h2 id="6">Optimism, Resilience and Mental Health Among Older Adults</h2>
<h3>Sheridan, C.L., Mental Health and Aging Newsletter. American Society on Aging (2004)</h3>
<p><em>Abstract</em></p>
<p>This article discusses major influences on resilient aging. In particular the interactions between social support and personal resilience are discussed. For &#8220;community dwelling&#8221; elderly people, resilience was a more strongly related to physical health and emotional state than was social support. The paper also provides a model relating several models of successful aging.</p>

<p>The articles in this blog are not short forms of previous articles. The closest we can come to more detail on material covered by the blog posts is in a book we have been preparing for some years. The draft we have is not yet ready for distribution. We will definitely call it to the attention of readers when it is ready.</p>
<p>In each post we provide guides to related publication. We put a good deal of effort into identifying suitable articles and books.</p>
