		<description><![CDATA[The articles in this blog are not short forms of previous articles. The closest we can come to more detail on material covered by the blog posts is in a book we have been preparing for some years. The draft we have is not yet ready for distribution. We will definitely call it to the attention of readers when it is ready.

In each post we provide guides to related publication. We put a good deal of effort into identifying suitable articles and books.
