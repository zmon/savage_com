<p><em>“Often, anti-stress programs come close to being useless. Their goal is off the mark and their method of creating change is misguided.</em></p>
<p><em>“When you are </em><em>told something in order to change your emotion system, the telling goes to the cognitive compartment of your brain. To control emotions and primitive bodily reactions, your brain has to pass those messages on through slow, winding pathways from the cognitive compartment to the emotion compartment.”</em></p>
<p><em>“…To move beyond mere “lip service”, you have two more steps:</em></p>
<ul>
<li>
<em>to develop </em><em>skills that reflect your new knowledge about resilience and</em>
</li>
<li><em>to practice those skills until they become habits.”</em></li>
</ul>
<p>************************************************************************</p>
<p>Often, anti-stress programs come close to being useless. Their goal is off the mark and their method of creating change is misguided. They focus too much on the goal of removing stress from your life rather than <em>strengthening yourself</em> against life’s inevitable sources of stress, Instead we have to learn how to <em>recover</em> from stress quickly and fully. We have to develop the skills needed to be <em>resilient</em>.</p>
<p>This old quotation summarizes the point exceptionally well:</p>
<p><em>“,,,the stability of a thing, just like that of a man, does not consist in its being shielded from all disturbances and thus preserving a precarious balance; it consists in the ability to recover from disturbances that inevitably will occur and to regain lost balance.” Wolfgang Langewiesche (1944)</em>.</p>
<p>Another problem with many stress management programs is that they merely <em>tell you what to do.</em> “Telling” is one of the least effective ways to get people to change.</p>

				<h2><em>Highlights:</em></h2>
<p><em>It is important to get clear about the deeply held values that make your change of habits personally valuable. To do that, you have to spend some time looking into yourself and asking what you will get out of making the desired changes.</em></p>
<p><em>In addition to this self-analysis, we advocate using a tested method called “mental contrasting”. Mental contrasting involves imagining how you and your life will be different after the changes and specifically contrasting the new you in the new life to the way you and your life are now. This approach has been shown to help people stick with their goals.</em></p>
<p>************************************************************************</p>
<p>If you are anything like me, and far too many people are when it comes to the things I am about to discuss, you often fail to do things you know will help when you are stressed. This is a major reason why people can be given wonderful lists of things to do that will make them more resilient, and just let the list fade out of their lives.</p>
<p>I recently got a copy of Tal Ben-Shahar’s interesting book “<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Happier-Learn-Secrets-Lasting-Fulfillment/dp/0071492399">Happier</a>” Ben-Shahar is apparently the originator of Harvard’s very popular course in Happiness. The most popular course at Harvard is based on Ben-Shahar’s work. “Happier” is a nice introduction to Ben-Shahar’s approach to becoming happier.</p>
<p>“Happier” has an interesting section on creating rituals. This section goes directly at the problem of getting yourself to do the things that are in your best interest. I found it especially interesting because Debbie and I have just finished a book that also includes a section on how to get yourself to do the procedures. It is always nice to find someone who is thinking along the same lines you are. Creating rituals is a good way to describe a core part of what we had written.</p>
<p>Ben-Shahar quotes Jim Loehr and Tony Schwartz on the value of building rituals: “Building rituals requires defining very precise behaviors and performing them at very specific times- motivated by deeply held values” ( For details, click <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0743226755/ref=pd_lpo_k2_dp_sr_1?ie=UTF8&amp;cloe_id=d4512d12-301d-4329-a745-5b90f7055505&amp;attrMsgId=LPWidget-A2&amp;pf_rd_p=486539851&amp;pf_rd_s=lpo-top-stripe-1&amp;pf_rd_t=201&amp;pf_rd_i=0743226747&amp;pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&amp;pf_rd_r=0H">here</a>). That is an excellent brief statement of what we need to do if we want to change our level of resilience. In fact, it is an excellent statement of how to build new habits in general.</p>

				<h2><em>Highlights</em></h2>
<p><em>&#8220;The point we are making here is that you can accomplish things that are now out of your reach if you commit yourself to mastering the art of deep relaxation. There are many methods for attaining these deep states, and we will start with one that is in particularly wide use for dealing with stress and fear. It is usually called “progressive relaxation”, and it is a good place to start for learning how to build your resilience through training. It is a starting place, and we will go far beyond it, but good training involves patiently going one step at a time.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>******************************************************************************************</p>
<p>So far we have talked about ways to increase resilience that are available to most people, without any special training. Yet there are many techniques that have been developed from experience going back to ancient times, or from scientific research. These techniques can take you far beyond where you can go with the methods familiar to most of us.</p>
<p>A few weeks ago, the daughter of a friend of ours ran the New York marathon. Debbie and I, along with a number of our brave runner’s other friends gathered to keep track of her progress. None of us could run a marathon. Probably even if we worked hard to prepare, few of us would get to the finish line.  Well at least I wouldn’t, though Debbie might.</p>
<p>Our friend&#8217;s daughter did what few of us could do, she finished the marathon. Yet, there were people in that race who finished a long time before she did.</p>
<p>We could say that those amazingly fast runners were, after all, physiologically gifted. But they also trained intensely, and probably with outstanding trainers.</p>
<p>Well-designed training can take us far beyond what we believe to be our limits. No matter what physiological gifts we have or don’t have, we can go far past what would be conceivable without skilled training.</p>
<p>A good illustration of this point can be found in a paper by cardiologists, Joel Dimsdale and Paul Mills. They were conducting a study of the effects on heartrate of a drug called Isoproterenol. This drug directly activates the bodily systems that speed up the heart. They were infusing it in the bloodstreams of volunteers in order to learn how increasing dosages affect heart-rate.</p>
<p>As expected, heart-rate increased as the dosage went up. But suddenly, the heartrate of one of the volunteers turned downward. This downward pattern continued until the heartrate was lower than it had been before the drug had been infused.</p>

				<p><em>…a pediatrician named Henry Bakwin took charge of the pediatric ward at Bellevue hospital. When Bakwin took command of the ward, there was a sign on its door saying that no one was to enter unless they had scrubbed twice. Bakwin had that sign removed and replaced with one that said “Do not enter this nursery without picking up a baby.” Nurses were instructed to hold the babies on their laps and cuddle them periodically. Despite the greater likelihood of contact with germs, infection rates dropped! Apparently physical contact trumped sterilization.</em></p>
<p><em>“…when people seek out contact comfort when stressed, they are following a path that is probably deeply engrained in our brains. There is much more to be said about the benefits of contact comfort, but I want to save that for later. Next it is time for something completely different.”</em></p>
<p>****************************************</p>
<p>A story in James Lynch’s book <span style="text-decoration: underline;">The Broken Heart</span> has stuck in my mind for several decades. Lynch was studying the heart’s response to human contact in hospital coronary care and trauma units. This was an extensive study, involving many patients, but the example that stayed with me was the story of a 54-year old man who died after 14 days in intensive care.</p>
<p>This man had a history of anxiety attacks and alcoholism. No one came to visit him during his 14 days in the hospital. Toward the end, he was comatose. A machine did his breathing for him. His heartbeat lacked the rhythm found in normal hearts, so it could no longer adequately carry out its task of pumping the blood needed by other organs.</p>
<p>As Lynch observed his chaotic heartbeat on a screen, a nurse came in and took the man’s hand. His heartbeat immediately became dramatically slower and more regular as she comforted him. When she released his hand and went on to other duties, the irregularities quickly returned. Simple physical touch had worked wonders for his dying heart.</p>
<p>This calming of the heart in response to touch was observed by Lynch in patient after patient. In this particular case the person doing the touching was an unfamiliar human being. Other evidence gathered by Lynch and many others showed that it probably would have had an even greater impact if a pet, especially a familiar one, had been touching him. In general, there is evidence that when humans pet animals, heart rate and blood pressure go down in both of them.</p>
<p>Another set of findings reveals even more about the power of contact on our health. In the early 1900’s death rates for hospitalized babies were remarkably high. A report that came out in 1915 indicated that infants admitted to 10 American asylums (a term used then for foundling homes and orphanages) had death rates from 31.5 to 75 percent.</p>
<p>The response to this was to institute elaborate procedures for keeping the wards as sterile as possible. Staff wore meticulously sterilized white gowns and gloves. Picking the babies up was viewed as increasing the risk of infection. To avoid contamination, in some institutions babies were fed with propped up bottles and had to eat without being held.</p>
<p>In this context a pediatrician named Henry Bakwin took charge of the pediatric ward at Bellevue hospital. When Bakwin took command of the ward, there was a sign on its door saying that no one was to enter unless they had scrubbed twice. Bakwin had that sign removed and replaced with one that said “Do not enter this nursery without picking up a baby.” Nurses were instructed to hold the babies on their laps and cuddle them periodically. Despite the greater likelihood of contact with germs, <em>infection rates dropped!</em> Apparently physical contact trumped sterilization.<br>

<p>For years we have been collecting information about what ordinary people under stress do to sooth, calm, and comfort themselves. A particularly useful source was an article in the New York Times about how New Yorkers handle stress. The article was not terribly important for our purposes, but the author asked readers to write and describe their own approaches to recovering from their reactions to stress. Over 300 people responded. We added their comments to our previous collection and then categorized them into what appear to be meaningful dimensions.</p>

</ul>
<p><em>“…if the stress is locked in, unlikely to change, and pervasive, it would be best to focus on strategies for controlling its impact, not on how stressed we are.”</em></p>
<p>Paradoxically, this generally optimistic blog was born of despair. For many years I worked, as a research-oriented professor studying stress. Like most stress researchers, I focused on the health consequences of living with a lot of stress.</p>
<p>It was the work of Aaron Antonovsky that steered me in a new direction. He was an American-Israeli medical sociologist who studied the qualities that determined who survived Hitler’s concentration camps and which survivors ended up healthier than others.</p>
<p>Antonovsky found that, at the center of this distinction was a set of attitudes he called “the sense of coherence”. People with a high sense of coherence managed to find something they could believe in and commit to even in this most toxic of environments.</p>
<p>Eventually Antonovsky’s studies led him to conclude that:</p>
<ul>
<li>there is enough stress in this world to make any and all of us get sick.</li>
<li>looking at variations in stress was not a smart approach for anyone interested in predicting who would break down or in making human life better.</li>

				<p><em>“People who do well in life don’t do so by arranging for it to be stress free or even close to that. If your source of stress is something you can change, you should change it. But, even after removing things like that, a lot of stress will remain.” </em></p>
<p>High resilience is the main key to living well in this stressful world.</p>
<p>Resilience is a set of attitudes, skills, and habits that make us, when challenged by stress, react less and recover more quickly and completely. There is good evidence that it can make us healthier and enable us to be more successful and happier.</p>
<p>For years the dominant idea has been that stress can make us sick, which is absolutely true. Almost daily there is more and better research attesting to the role of stress in health, illness, quality of life, and success in life. This evidence tells us that we really need to find ways to limit the impact of stress. How do we do that?</p>
<p>If you think back on magazine articles you’ve read, lectures you’ve heard, or advice you’ve gotten from friends, it’s likely they have all emphasized reducing your stress. But if you look closely at what has stressed you, you will find that most of it has been either entirely or largely out of your control.</p>
<p>You can’t just decide not to get laid off, not to have your “life” partner fall in love with someone else, or not to go through the holiday season.</p>
