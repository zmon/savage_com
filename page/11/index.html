				<div class="entry-content">
				<p>How can you get relief from the uncomfortable and often painful, feelings we all have when distressed? A technique called “Focusing” is clearly one of the best ways. In this post we will</p>
<ul>
<li>Explain what Focusing is.</li>
<li>Show you how to focus.</li>
<li>Direct you to excellent      resources to learn more about using it.</li>
</ul>
<p>When we have distressed feelings, most of us try to get rid of them, to tell them they are not reasonable, etc. but that usually does not work.</p>
<p>A more effective approach is to do things that are incompatible with distress, such as <a href="/category/deep-relaxation/">deep relaxation</a>. But there is also a further possibility, one that involves listening to the <em>meaning</em> of your body’s reactions.</p>
<h2>The Focusing Technique</h2>
<p>With Focusing, you turn <strong><em>toward</em></strong> what you feel rather than trying to make it go away. You visit with the feelings and listen, in an accepting way, to what they have to tell you.  When you understand the feelings better, you will notice a bodily sense of relief.  You must use this shift in your <strong><em>bodily reaction</em></strong> as a sign that you are on the right track.</p>
<h2>Example of How to Focus</h2>
<p>I will illustrate how Focusing works with a personal example. I had to see a doctor who, due to a misunderstanding, had been very harsh during our first visit. I had decided not to shift doctors in “midstream”, but to never see him again once my health issue was resolved.</p>
<p>On the way to my second visit with him I felt tense and anxious. I decided to focus on what I was feeling in my body and to open myself to what these bodily feelings had to tell me. I focused on the feelings and asked them, just as I would with an acquaintance, what they were about. As words came to me, I checked with my body to see if they fit.</p>
<p>When the right words came to me, I felt a change in the bodily feeling.  This shift told me I was improving my understanding of what was going on. After several of these steps, I finally came up with the words “I need help and I don’t want to fight about it.” Immediately I felt a shift in my body’s sensations that calmed me and told me that I was right on the button.</p>
<p>When I saw the doctor, everything was different. Now he seemed to fit a description I had previously gotten of him as “nice”, and he took good care of me.</p>
<p>I suspect that my clarification of how I felt not only made me feel better, but also made the way I dealt with the doctor more positive so that he could be less defensive and more positive.</p>
<h2>How Can You Learn More About Focusing?</h2>
<p>Where can you learn more about how to Focus? My first recommendation is that you get a copy of Ann Weiser Cornell’s book “<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Power-Focusing-Practical-Emotional-Self-Healing/dp/157224044X/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1303834189&amp;sr=1-3">The Power of Focusing</a>”.  I have read many books on Focusing, but nothing is as useful as her book. She is lucid in guiding you through each step.</p>
<p>You can also view <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7PEC5Mh5FY">YouTube videos of the creator of Focusing, Eugene Gendlin, teaching people how to Focus</a>.</p>
<p>Weiser Cornell’s book is inexpensive (You can even get <a href="http://www.focusingresources.com/downloads/pof1.pdf">the first chapter</a> for free!) and the YouTube videos are free. I recommend that you use both.</p>

				<div class="entry-content">
				<p>In the last post, I pointed out the importance of clarifying and expressing your feelings of distress. Understanding how you feel about a distressing situation and expressing it in a safe context can make you feel better and stay healthier.</p>
<p>For years many in the mental health field have encouraged people to blow off steam, let out their anger, and get things off their chest. It was a model that implied that, when we are upset, we are like a boiler that is overheated, and that will blow up if it does not release some of the pressure. But humans are much more complex than boilers.</p>
<p>This way of handling distress, which is called “venting”, is <strong><em>not</em></strong> likely to make you feel better or become healthier.</p>
<p>Carol Tavris and Elliot Aronson gave a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Mistakes-Were-Made-But-Not/dp/0156033909/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1303097019&amp;sr=1-1">nice, concise summary of the effects of venting:</a></p>
<p>“…when people vent they often feel worse, pump up their blood pressure, and make themselves even angrier. Venting is especially likely to backfire if a person commits an aggressive act against another person directly…”.</p>
<p>There are commonly social ramifications of venting. Venting or dumping strong negative feelings on other people is likely to lead to reactions on their part that will create more stress. People have a way of making a person who is venting and dumping on them pay a price for doing so. And so the original stress gets amplified instead of being brought under control.</p>
<p>More careful therapists were likely to have people “get their anger out” by having them do things like yelling and screaming at pillows or beating on them with bats wrapped in foam rubber. This avoids antagonizing others and thereby amplifying stress.</p>
<p>However, if you don’t have a deep inner connection to your words and actions, these methods are not likely to resolve the issues. This pounding and yelling is probably, at best, a way to get a bit of exercise.</p>
<p>Fully articulating feelings tends to produce healthy outcomes, e.g. <a href="/page/2011/04/13/control-distress-by-understanding-and-expressing-yourself/">fewer physical symptoms</a>, <a href="http://homepage.psy.utexas.edu/homepage/faculty/pennebaker/reprints/Kiecolt.pdf">fewer visits to health care facilities, and improved immunity</a>. This articulating, unlike venting, involves a serious look at what has you upset and how you feel about it. You should come away from the experience with a sense of greater self-understanding and of relief.</p>
<p>The following are some clues that you are engaging in unproductive venting:</p>
<ul>
<li>When you vent, you do not      feel a sense of progressing toward recovery; you can go over and over the      problem without moving forward at all.</li>
<li>Your inner tension is      likely to improve little if at all, and often will rise.</li>
<li>You don’t get a feeling of      deepening your understanding of yourself and why you are reacting as you      are.</li>
<li>You don’t get a glimmer of      how you might proceed to improve the situation or live well in spite of      it.</li>
<li>Commonly the focus is on      others, on how awful and wicked they are.</li>
</ul>

				<p>In this post, I want to discuss the third factor we <a href="/2011/01/11/the-three-core-factors-that-can-make-you-more-resilient/">identified in our research on personal resilience</a>. It involves two things:</p>
<ul>
<li>Attending to and clarifying      your feelings about distressing experiences.</li>
<li>Expressing those clarified      feelings in a safe way that enables you to feel clearer and better about      them.</li>
</ul>
<p>As with the other two factors, this one has been the object of much research. <a href="http://homepage.psy.utexas.edu/homepage/faculty/pennebaker/Reprints/index.htm">James Pennebaker</a> was the researcher who first identified it as important. He and his  co-workers found that women who reported having been sexually abused  also reported, later in life, a markedly elevated number of symptoms of  ill health. However, if they had opportunities to <strong><em>express</em></strong> their feelings about the experience, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Opening-Up-Healing-Expressing-Emotions/dp/1572302380/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1302704279&amp;sr=1-1">the symptoms were markedly diminished</a>.</p>
<p>There is good research that supports the idea that expressing feelings reduces bodily responses to stress. For example, <a href="http://ist-socrates.berkeley.edu/%7Eucbpl/docs/51-Hiding%20Feelings97.pdf">Robert Levenson</a> found that people who participated in an experiment in which they were  required to watch a gruesome video of the amputation of a human limb had  stronger physiological reactions to the experience if they were also  asked to <strong><em>hide</em></strong> those reactions. (The video was gruesome enough that even those told to conceal their reactions were not fully able to comply.)</p>
<p>This  and similar research indicates that it is a healthy thing to spend the  time and effort to understand your feelings and to find a way to  articulate them.</p>
<p>A very good method is to talk to a well-trusted  friend. Of course, that kind of friend is often not available. Be  careful about expressing your private reactions to people who are not  solidly on your side. Instead of helping, it can make things worse,  amplify stress, and turn a small problem into a big one.</p>
<p>Fortunately, research shows us that <strong><em><a href="http://homepage.psy.utexas.edu/HomePage/Faculty/Pennebaker/Reprints/P1997.pdf">journaling privately to articulate how you feel about bad experiences also works</a></em></strong>. If you are in doubt about the supportiveness of potential listeners, it might be wise to use journaling.</p>
<p>In either case, focus on how you <strong><em>feel</em></strong> about the distressing situation. Do not worry about your style,  grammar, etc. Clarifying what you feel is the crux of the matter.</p>
<p>Later we will have more to say about how to <strong><em>listen to yourself</em></strong> enough to clarify your feelings about bad situations.</p>

				<p>This post is about the power of anticipating risks and preparing for them through practice.</p>
<p><a href="/page/2011/01/27/through-adversity-to-the-stars/?#more-555">Earlier</a> we discussed a major study of what leads to success in life. The study tracked Harvard students from  youth to old age in order to find characteristics that were precursors of the ability to have good, sustainable relationships and to be successful in one’s work life. The results were summarized in a book called “<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Adaptation-Life-George-Vaillant/dp/0674004140/ref=sr_1_4?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1302110622&amp;sr=1-4">Adaptation to Life</a>”, by George Vaillant. Among other things, the investigators identified “anticipation” as an important factor.</p>
<p>Anticipation is the tendency to think ahead, to scope out problems and prepare for them before they arrive in overwhelming force.</p>
<p>An excellent example of the power of anticipation as a resilience resource was described in Amanda Ripley’s book “<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Unthinkable-Survives-When-Disaster-Strikes/dp/0307352900/ref=ntt_at_ep_dpt_1">The Unthinkable</a>”. She describes how one man saved close to 3000  lives during the 9/11 attack, and sacrificed his own.</p>
<p>The man was Rick Rescorla, a decorated Veteran of the Vietnam War, who took a job that called upon him to take care of the security of Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, which occupied several floors of Tower Two.</p>
<p>You may or may not know that the Towers had been attacked earlier, in the early 1990’s. Rescorla, with the help of a carefully selected colleague, had anticipated that the easiest way to attack them was to drive a truck full of timed explosives into the lower floor parking lot and walk away. This is exactly what happened in the earlier attack.</p>
<p>Rescorla was confident that another attack was coming. He and his expert colleague even decided that it most likely would involve flying a plane loaded with explosives into the Towers.</p>

<p>As a result, you miss important cues, especially the subtle social cues needed to deal effectively with others. You are also likely to have trouble thinking clearly and solving problems.</p>
<p>Some years ago, I dubbed this “neurotic stupidity”. We don’t even notice this “I.Q. drop” because we are too overloaded to observe our own mental processes.</p>
<p>Our sensory and memory systems have huge capacity so it is hard to believe our brain has such an <a href="http://www.musanim.com/miller1956/">astonishingly limited “channel capacity”</a> or &#8220;bandwidth&#8221;.</p>
<p>Very important is that our brains have to process huge amounts of information from our muscles. Notice that when actors imitate robots they inevitably do so by moving very clumsily. This is because even simple movements require processing of very complex information.  A lot of information from muscles, tendons, etc. has to be processed to get movements right.</p>
<p>Information from the muscles is largely handled below the conscious level, so we do not notice it.  Still, it floods our brains.</p>
<p>That is one reason why learning one or two techniques of <a href="/2010/12/06/a-key-step-in-resilience-training-is-learning-deep-relaxation/">deep relaxation</a> is important. Relaxation of our muscles blocks stress responses but also reduces the information load on our brains, thus <em>broadening our awareness and enhancing our creativity</em>.</p>
<p>There is at least one way that our limited channel capacity <em>can actually help us</em>. If we direct our attention to positive things, there is no room left for the negative ones.</p>

				<p>Earlier, I explained that there are <a href="/2011/01/11/the-three-core-factors-that-can-make-you-more-resilient/">three factors that indicate whether people are resilient</a>. For this post, I want to go back to the second resilience factor, discussed previously, about <a href="/2011/02/20/to-increase-your-resilience-avoid-being-too-hard-on-yourself/">not being too hard on yourself</a>.</p>
<p>Many of us attack ourselves when we are down. Here are some words <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Mental-ABCs-Pitching-Performance-Enhancement/dp/1888698292/ref=sr_1_3?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1300375346&amp;sr=1-3">Harvey Dorfman</a>, a major league pitching coach heard his extremely talented athletes apply to themselves: “idiot,” “loser,” “dummy,” “gutless,” and “I stink,” “I can’t,” “I don’t have it,” and “I’m clueless.” Notice that these are nasty and inaccurate. Even if on a given occasion they had made a mistake, they wouldn’t be major league pitchers if they were losers, idiots, etc.</p>
<p>Recently Glamor Magazine did a <a href="http://www.glamour.com/health-fitness/2011/02/shocking-body-image-news-97-percent-of-women-will-be-cruel-to-their-bodies-today">survey of women’s attitudes toward their bodies</a>, and here are some things the surveyed women had to say about themselves: “You are a fat, worthless pig.” “You’re too thin. No man is ever going to want you.” “Ugly. Big. Gross.” Ninety-seven percent of surveyed women had at least one such thought per day and, on average, the women had close to one of these thoughts per waking hour.</p>
<p>As a full-time professor I used to lecture on overweight, obesity, and weight loss. I always marveled at the intense attention students, especially women, gave as I spoke. Very lovely, well-formed women whom any sensible person would see as attractive were intensely interested in how to lose weight. And they were more than willing to listen to a paunchy professor tell them how to do that!</p>
<p>People who tend to speak abusively to themselves diminish their level of resilience, and so presumably lose at least some of the many advantages of being resilient. We are talking, after all, about the second most important resilience factor.</p>
<p>If, when under stress, we are nasty to ourselves, we just ratchet up the mental and physical stress reactions, and slow our recovery.</p>
<p>Recently the New York Times ran an article centering on <a href="http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/02/28/go-easy-on-yourself-a-new-wave-of-research-urges/">the work of Kristin Neff on Self-Compassion</a>. By going to <a href="https://webspace.utexas.edu/neffk/pubs/listofpublications.htm">Dr. Neff’s website</a>, I saw that this topic has been the subject of a lot of research, not just by her, but by many others. Somehow I had missed it, despite my constant efforts to find <em>everything</em> relevant to resilience.</p>
<p>Her work took me one step further in clarifying what that second resilience factor is. It is about being compassionate toward yourself. To me that feels richer than merely putting an end to being mean to yourself. Compassion is not just the absence of meanness. It implies treating yourself in a caring, understanding, and loving way.</p>
<p>I am going to end this post with a valuable quotation from a <a href="https://webspace.utexas.edu/neffk/pubs/JRP.pdf">paper by Dr. Neff</a> that clarifies the concept of self-compassion:</p>
<p>“If individuals are self-compassionate when confronting suffering, inadequacy or failure, it means that they offer themselves warmth and non-judgmental understanding rather than belittling their pain or berating themselves with self-criticism.”</p>

				<div class="entry-content">
				<p>About a year ago, I stumbled on a series of short <a href="http://www.google.com/#q=shawn+achor+youtube&amp;hl=en&amp;prmd=ivnso&amp;source=univ&amp;tbs=vid:1&amp;tbo=u&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=bqB5TZbzH8WEqgHJ2IDeBQ&amp;ved=0CCoQqwQ&amp;bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.&amp;fp=172639ded0fa996d">YouTube videos</a>, by Shawn Achor, on how to become happier. He is a delightful lecturer and his topic could hardly be more important. Achor taught a course on positive psychology at Harvard and one seventh of Harvard undergraduates enrolled in the course. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positive_psychology">Positive psychology</a> is an approach that places its main emphasis on guiding people, including those who are already functioning well, to function at better levels.</p>
<p>After seeing Achor’s videos, I went in search of more information about new research on how people can learn to be more happy.</p>
<p>Achor mentions that a professor named Tal Ben Shahar had developed the positive psychology course so I looked for his work. Shahar has written several guides to increasing happiness. One was a book called “<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Happier-Learn-Secrets-Lasting-Fulfillment/dp/0071492399/ref=ntt_at_ep_dpi_1">Happier</a>” and another was a book called “<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Even-Happier-Gratitude-Journal-Fulfillment/dp/0071638032/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1299817033&amp;sr=8-1">Even Happier</a>”. Recently, Shawn Achor published a very readable book “<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Happiness-Advantage-Principles-Psychology-Performance/dp/0307591549">The Happiness Advantage</a>: The Seven Principles of Positive Psychology That Fuel Success and Performance at Work”. It is a pleasant read, and a nice overview of current research on how to become happier.</p>
<p>What was most striking for me in these books was the remarkable overlap between what makes people happy and what makes them resilient. The overlap is so extensive that it would be reasonable to wonder whether the principles of happiness and the principles of resilience are the same.</p>
<p>To illustrate in a concise way, let’s consider the procedures Achor offers in his final summary in the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQt_WNewOKs">third YouTube video</a>. You can find it in the last few minutes of that video. They are:</p>
<p>1.      Gratitudes: taking note each day of several things that went well that day, and that you are grateful for.</p>
<p>2.      Journaling: Spending three minutes each day writing about something that went well.</p>
<p>3.      Simplifying your life and avoiding multitasking.</p>
<p>4.      Focusing on your strengths and building from them.</p>
<p>5.      Exercise.</p>
<p>6.      Meditation, specifically mindfulness meditation.</p>
<p>Numbers 1, 2, 5, and 6 are important aspects of our approach to resilience training. The remaining two are present in our training, but haven’t been central training principles. It would not be unreasonable to include them as central.</p>
<p>There are also many aspects of resilience training that are not in this list. For example, mastering the skill of deep relaxation, or learning how to breathe in a way that helps you stay reasonably cool under pressure. So resilience training seems to have a wider range than happiness training. Though resilience training helps you to function effectively under threat and stress, it also enhances life satisfaction when your baseline is fairly good.</p>
<p>In any case, it seems that when you are doing resilience training, you are also doing happiness training.</p>
<p>A reasonable question would be the old “chicken and egg” one. Does happiness cause resilience or does resilience cause happiness? The truth is, we don’t know. For the scientifically minded, it is a complicated question, but for those who simply want a better life all that matters is that the resilience training can be expected to make them both more resilient <em>and</em> happier.</p>

				<p>Mindfulness meditation emphasizes acceptance of and compassion for whatever we experience. It is a useful practice for almost anyone, but especially for someone who is inclined to be harsh and critical toward herself or himself.</p>
<p>The details of mindfulness technique vary all over the map, but all of them teach us to be aware of what we are experiencing in the moment, and to allow it to BE, without criticism.</p>
<p>This is our preferred approach:</p>
<ul>
<li>Arrange a reasonably quiet      environment to help you acquire the skills needed to practice mindfulness.      (Later you can practice in any environment).</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>You can practice while      sitting or lying down.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Fix your attention on the      rising and falling of the abdomen as you breathe in and out. You can      inwardly say to yourself “rising” as you inhale and “falling” as you      exhale. Your attention should be directed at the rising and falling of the      abdomen and not on the breathing itself.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Each time your attention      strays you should make a mental note of it, and then gently but firmly      return your attention to the rising and falling of your abdomen.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>If extraneous thoughts      come to you, categorize them by naming them. For example you could use the      labels “worrying”, “imagining”, “remembering”, or simply “wandering”.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>If a distraction keeps      coming back, you should shift your attention to that distraction and use      it as the object of contemplation instead of using the rising and falling.</li>
</ul>
<p>It&#8217;s that simple. Just attend to what is present in each moment and learn to be uncritically accepting of whatever experience presents itself.</p>

				<div class="entry-content">
				<p>In a previous post we described the three core factors that underlie resilience. Mostly we have talked about the first factor. The second factor has to do with:</p>
<ol>
<li>Treating your minor      mistakes as awful and catastrophic.</li>
<li>Being excessively self-critical.</li>
<li>Setting unrealistically      high standards that are usually unattainable.</li>
</ol>
<p>In plain language, it is being too hard on yourself. It is very likely to make you less resilient and more vulnerable.</p>
<p>The three item list above is identical to what many researchers who explore this topic simply call “perfectionism” or “maladaptive perfectionism”.</p>
<p>Perfectionists cannot tolerate even the smallest mistakes, berate themselves for any slip ups, and view results that are less than perfect as completely unacceptable. Clearly, perfectionism can make <strong><em>anything</em></strong> stressful.</p>
<p>The resilience-training alternatives to these three items are</p>
<p>1.                <em>Learning</em> to treat your minor mistakes realistically, with tolerance and acceptance.</p>
<p>2.                <em>Learning</em> to question and forcefully challenge the self-critical voice inside you, replace the criticism with ideas about how to do better in the future.</p>
<p>3.                <em>Learning</em> that having unrealistically high standards is not admirable or a path to success.</p>
<p>There are many levels of perfectionism. The severe ones are best dealt with in treatment with a qualified therapist. For example, perfectionistic people who are so thwarted that they have become severely depressed should consider therapy. That doesn’t exclude self-training. In fact, therapists commonly refer clients to our resilience training, as an adjunct to their therapy.</p>
<p>Most of us who stress ourselves by being too perfectionistic can improve considerably in one of two ways:</p>
<p>1.                Regularly and steadfastly challenging thoughts that point to unfair and unrealistic internal demands. If, when you make a mistake, your inner critic claims you are stupid or your action is going to result in catastrophic losses, or even that you would be better off dead, don’t take that lying down. Be your own defense attorney and demand solid evidence for the critic&#8217;s claims.</p>
<p>2.                Practicing some form of mindfulness meditation.</p>
<p>Here is a <a href="http://hubpages.com/hub/Dont-Be-Beaten-Down-by-Self-Critical-Thoughts">good account of how to challenge and diminish your self-critical thoughts</a>. In the next post we will describe our preferred method of mindfulness meditation. You should also take a look at the book “<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Pursuit-Perfect-Chasing-Perfection-Happier/dp/0071608826">The Pursuit of Perfect: How to Stop Chasing Perfection and Start Living a RICHER, HAPPIER Life</a>”, by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tal_Ben-Shahar">Tal Ben-Shahar</a>. It is a book with heart, combining a narrative of his personal struggle to overcome perfectionism with science-based, helpful techniques.</p>
