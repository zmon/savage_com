<p>Debbie and I have been immersed in resilience training for decades, and we agreed to make a list of the top five or so actions we would recommend if someone asked us to outline a basic project to improve their resilience. There was a lot of overlap between our lists, but, blending them, we ended up with eight instead of five.</p>
<p>These methods are supported by scientific evidence, and also by our personal experience. They are definitely worth a try. Typically, they are also enjoyable.</p>
<ol>
<li>Think back on what has      helped succeed in pulling out of stress in the past. Make a list of things      that worked, and begin doing those things regularly.</li>
<li>Review our <a href="/2010/11/04/natural-stress-defeaters/">list      of things other people have found effective in recovering from stressful      days</a>. Select one or two to try for yourself. Don’t just put the list      in a drawer! Really try them out.</li>
<li>Learn how to relax deeply.      For a start, download the free relaxation audio we provided at the end of      our earlier <a href="/2010/12/06/a-key-step-in-resilience-training-is-learning-deep-relaxation/">post      on deep relaxation</a>. Listen to it several days each week for at least      two weeks.</li>
<li>If you haven’t been      exercising regularly, pick an exercise method that appeals to you and do      the exercise several days per week for at least two weeks. If possible,      find someone you like spending time with and invite them to join you. Or      bring along an energetic pet.</li>
<li>Take a <a href="/2011/08/09/handling-distress-the-power-of-optimism-hope-and-a-problem-solving-attitude/">Problem      Solving attitude</a> toward problems, stressors and frustrations. Solutions      that lead to success may be nearer at hand than you think.</li>
<li>Seek out people who make      you feel better about yourself or who are good models of resilience. Find      a way to spend time with them.</li>
<li>Select an easy, relaxing      method of deep controlled breathing and use it several times a day. Then      use it when you really need it.</li>
<li>When you find yourself      with a self -critical attitude or thinking negatively</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>It’s no time to start reviewing your failings when you are having trouble dealing with distress. Re-focus on problem solving. What can you do right now to make things better? What path has promise as a path to success. Check tip number 5 above.</li>
<li>Don’t just roll over and accept self- criticism or negative thinking. Imagine what a defense attorney might do to challenge them, and be your own defense attorney. Defense attorneys interpret what their clients do in the best way possible. It’s a perspective that you should at least consider.

				<div class="entry-content">
				<p>It is remarkably easy to forget how resilient we have been over the years, and still are. It’s worthwhile to get a reminder from time to time of what we have come through to be where we are this very day.</p>
<p>A quotation from Winston Churchill makes this point very well on a world scale.</p>
<p>On December 30 1941, with Britain engaged in what was to be World War II, Winston Churchill said this to the Canadian Parliament: &#8220;We have not journeyed across the centuries, across the oceans, across the mountains, across the prairies, because we are made of sugar candy.&#8221;</p>
<p>I don’t know of a better affirmation of resilience. Like Churchill, we have all survived despite challenging and even terrifying threats.</p>
<p>The Brits had declared war against Germany in 1939, after it had become clear that Hitler would not be satisfied with any tolerable concessions. Britain was not in a strong position to deal with the German juggernaut.</p>
<p>It took remarkable courage to stand up to Hitler unilaterally. Churchill had long warned England of what the Nazis were likely to do, and he was rejected for those warnings. Once it became clear that he was right, he was chosen to lead his country through the ensuing war.</p>
<p>Churchill was <em>ready</em> to deal with the coming threat, even though his ideas had been rejected by the majority of his countrymen. He had anticipated the conflicts that would result from Hitler’s ambitions.</p>
<p>On the smaller scale in which most of us live, readiness or “anticipation” is an important aspect of resilience. The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Adaptation-Life-George-Vaillant/dp/0674004140">Harvard Grant Study</a>, in which Harvard students were watched through their lifespan, listed anticipation, which leads to readiness, as one of the core skills that lead to a good, successful life.</p>
<p>When you are first learning to build your resilience, it may be very hard for you to think ahead and strengthen yourself to respond to what is likely to come. But, once you are able, you should do your best to develop the skill of anticipation.</p>
<p>Do this without being impatient if you are presently too overwhelmed to deal with anything beyond the load you are bearing right now.</p>
<p>And you should not forget that you are not “made of sugar candy”. Think about it. Sugar candy can easily be made to melt, break, or fall apart.</p>
<p>You wouldn’t be alive today and reading a blog on resilience if you hadn’t gotten through many painful experiences that challenged your capacity to survive and succeed. You may have been scared or in pain, but you didn’t melt, break, or fall apart.</p>
<p>I know it is easy to forget these successes and focus instead on the threats.  So why not think instead of the many distressing experiences you have survived, intact? And think about the strengths and the strategies that got you to where you are.</p>
<p>If your life had been easy, or if it had broken you, you probably wouldn’t be interested in learning how to be resilient. And even to bother to learn about resilience, you must have hope that you can do better. Hope, too, is an aspect of resilience.</p>
<p>There are always steps you can take to move forward, even when the situation seems bleak. You have done it before, and you can do it now.</p>

				<div class="entry-content">
				<p>Resilient people tend to take a problem-solving attitude toward stressful situations. That attitude is closely linked to optimism and hope, which are known to foster resilience.</p>
<p>Let me explain by retelling a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Mental-ABCs-Pitching-Performance-Enhancement/dp/1888698292/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1312857020&amp;sr=8-3">story</a> from Sports Psychologist and Major League pitching coach, <a href="http://captnsblog.wordpress.com/2011/03/01/mind-games-harvey-dorfman%E2%80%99s-impact-on-the-mental-state-of-baseball/">Harvey Dorfman</a>. He describes an encounter with a pitcher, Steve Mura, who had spent six seasons in the Major League and won 12 games for the 1983 Cardinals He was the starting pitcher for that night’s game.</p>
<p>Dorfman was chatting with him, and Mura shook his head silently. When asked what that was about, he said, “I can never win on this mound.”</p>
<p>In the ensuing discussion, Dorfman told Mura, “There is a difference between, ‘I have not won and I cannot win’.” After all, there are many things we accomplish for the first time. Otherwise there would be no such thing as breaking one’s personal record.</p>
<p>When questioned further, Mura complained about the height and slope of the pitching mound. Dorfman asked him what kind of adjustments he could make to deal with that. Mura thought it over and came up with a strategy. He had never done that before. Mura pitched seven innings that night and gave up only two runs on hits.</p>
<p>So, Mura began in a state of pessimism and hopelessness. As Dorfman pointed out, why should anyone think about solving the problem if failure is foreordained? And if they do not even begin problem solving, they obviously cannot persist in finding a way to succeed.</p>
<p>Once Mura shifted from pessimism and hopelessness to a problem-solving mode, it took only a few minutes to develop a plan of adjustments that led to success.</p>
<p>We often block ourselves from problem-solving by attributing our failures to our inherent characteristics. Think of the student who gets a poor grade on a test and concludes, “I am just stupid”. How does she or he solve that problem? Seems pretty hopeless to me.</p>
<p>What if, instead, the student thinks, “I wonder if the teacher could show me some better ways to study or to take notes.” Or, “I wonder if I could study with Zoey ; she always gets A’s?” That’s the opening of a problem solving attitude, which can easily lead to optimism and hope, and maybe even a romance. And from there to resilience and a real shot at success.</p>

				<p>For today’s post, Debbie and I have decided to provide a link to a video about a person who has shown remarkable resilience despite awful disadvantages. If you react to it the way we did, it will also give you a positive experience, that can shift your brain into a deeper, happier, more creative place. Click <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BewknNW2b8Y&amp;feature=player_embed%3C/p%3E">here</a> to find the video.</p>
<p>The brain stores experiences in something resembling the folders on computers (or in good old-fashioned filing cabinets). When a folder is open, information on the topic in that folder is readily available, thus easily retrieved.</p>
<p>So when you are having a hard time, the tendency is to have thoughts that are about pains, threats, or suffering. In the short run, that kind of thinking can help you devise ways to deal with the stressful experience. But if it goes on too long, it impairs resilience.</p>
<p>The mind, during uncontrolled stress, tends to narrow its focus and respond with primitive reactions that are often (but not always) useful for survival in mortal combat, but not likely to help us find creative solutions in everyday life.</p>
<p>An extreme of the negative aspect of reacting to painful, threatening situations is “tunnel vision”, in which your visual field looks as if you are viewing through a small tube.</p>
<p>David Grossman pointed out in his book “<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Combat-Psychology-Physiology-Deadly-Conflict/dp/0964920549/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1311048673&amp;sr=8-1">On Combat</a>”, that the stress of lethal conflict induces tunnel vision about 80% of the time. We become oblivious to all but the things most central to what threatens us.  It also limits us to tried deeply embedded, primitive responses, leaving little room for creative reactions.</p>
<p>To think more positively and thus get to a more resilient place, it helps to open a different “folder”, one full of positive thoughts and experiences. Recent research shows that even very simple positive experiences help you open that kind of brain folder. That research is nicely summarized in a book called “<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Positivity-Groundbreaking-Research-Strength-Negativity/dp/0307393739/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1311048730&amp;sr=1-1">Positivity</a>” by  Barbara Frederickson.</p>
<p>Dr. Frederickson is a psychologist who developed the “<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broaden-and-build">broaden and build model</a>”, a model indicating that positive emotions enable us to broaden our awareness and thus to function in more creative and more effective ways.</p>
<p>Research in the area of “positivity” has shown in many studies that people perform better right after positive experiences, even after something as simple as tasting a chocolate treat. So we should all try to include something positive and fun each day.</p>
<p>For Debbie and me, watching this video was not only positive, but also inspiring. Please let us know your reaction to it.</p>

				<p>In this post I want to take a closer look at what resilience is and who can gain from training to increase it.</p>
<p>People often tell me that I should explain resilience as the ability to “bounce back” from stress. I hate that view of resilience. It always reminds me of those inflated dummies that are designed to come right back to an upright position after they are punched, setting themselves up to be punched again. That is not resilience. It is mindlessness, literally in this case.</p>
<p>A much better description of resilience is “playing a poor hand well”. There is a pretty good <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Playing-Poor-Hand-Well-Professional/dp/0393702324" target="_self">book by that title</a>, and I commend the author for the book and the title.</p>
<p>But even that title fails to get it quite right. Resilience is having the ability to play <em>any</em> hand well. If you were dealt a poor hand, resilience is the set of abilities that enable you to perform above expectations. If you were dealt a good hand, it is the set of abilities that enable you to make the most of it. In other words, resilience enables you to deal with stress efficiently and effectively, to recover from stress more quickly and more completely. But, stress aside, it enables you to perform at your best level, whether in your work, in sports, or in relationships.</p>
<p>So it is not easy to target precisely who needs resilience training because the audience is really just about everybody. Maybe the best way to pinpoint who is a good match for training and who is not is to break people down into:</p>
<ul>
<li>Those who need help in developing      their skills for dealing with stress and living up to their potential in      life and also know they need help.</li>
<li>Those who need help in      developing those skills and do not know it.</li>
</ul>
<p>A final word.</p>
<p>Years ago I used to lend a large set of my data on stress and resilience for use in an advanced statistics class, where the students were learning to find the meanings hidden in masses of data. The instructor always invited me to sit in on a long session in which each student reported on their findings. In one of those classes a student who was a real standout in statistics reported that she had detected a very large factor in the data, for which she had struggled to give an adequate name. She decided to call it “Good Life”.</p>
<p>It was the factor that made the largest contribution to resilience. After many more years of study, we identified that factor as “resilient attitudes and skills”. I often think that “Good Life” gives an excellent sense of what developing resilient attitudes and skills might provide.</p>

				<p>This post introduces you to a very creative designer, Stefan Sagmeister, who also had the discipline to review the scientific literature on happiness, He points out some things that, surprisingly, do not influence your happiness. Then, he explains some ways to be happier. And he does it in a funny and delightful way. I got a kick out of it.</p>
<p>In an <a href="/2011/03/11/resilience-and-happiness/">earlier post</a> we talked about how factors that influence resilience and those that influence happiness are very similar. The pursuit of happiness and the pursuit of resilience are almost interchangeable. Sagmeister is in sync with this blog in that he is intent on training his mind in a particular way to enable him to feel greater well-being. We are too.</p>
<p>He does a good job of summarizing some surprising data that tell us that much of what we <strong><em>think</em></strong> will make us happy or sad really isn’t very important. For example, such things as your gender, how much money you make, whether you live in a nice climate or a nasty one, whether you are old or young, how healthy you are, and whether you are ugly or beautiful have surprisingly little effect.</p>
<p>He describes several things that are likely to increase your happiness; to me, the most striking are:</p>
<ul>
<li>doing more of things you      like to do,</li>
<li>having people you can feel      close to,</li>
<li>doing what really means      something to you</li>
<li>keeping a diary.</li>
</ul>
<p>These recommendations for happiness correspond very well with the recommendations for stopping stress through resilience you can find throughout this blog.  <a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/stefan_sagmeister_7_rules_for_making_more_happiness.html">View the video</a> to get his comments on what he got from that practice and also to enjoy his animations.</p>

				<p>I use tactical breathing regularly. In this post I will describe a recent experience in which the breathing tool really helped. Reading this detailed account of how to use it while being challenged from several directions may help you apply it when you need to.</p>
<p>People tend to think that anyone teaching resilience should be super-resilient. Actually I, like many other psychologists, was drawn to my favorite topic as a form of self-help. I come from a long line of tense and anxious people.  It is far from easy for me to deal with situations that are difficult and threatening. Medical settings are particularly troubling for me.</p>
<p>I have a problem with my spine that leads to chronic pain, sometimes very severe pain. Recently my doctor recommended that I have steroid injections in my spine. You can well imagine that the procedure is not comfortable.</p>
<p>The Spinal Pain Clinic emphasized the importance of being there on time. When I got within a block of the clinic, construction work blocked my access. I then turned to circumvent the barrier, and the next street also was shut off for construction.  I suppose that’s to be expected at a hospital that is doing very well.</p>
<p>I did a few inhalations to the count of 4 with exhalations to the count of 7. However, it was hard because I had to concentrate on how to get there. Still, I had allowed extra time, so I was able to find a way through several more obstacles to arrive on time. The delays had rattled me a little, but the partial use of breath control helped reduce my tension.</p>
<p>After filling out the required paperwork (which I hate), I settled down in the waiting room. I was able to quietly do my breathing procedure, but was quickly called into a room where I was asked a lot of questions, and where, once again, my brain was taken up with composing answers, leaving little opportunity to regulate my breathing.</p>
<p>Soon I was taken to what looked like an operating room, told to take down my pants and get in an uncomfortable position that was necessary to get the needles in the right places. At that point I was able to do tactical breathing with little distraction. The injection caused fairly intense pain for a short while, but that was not hard for me. I’m used to it.</p>
<p>Soon they helped me into a wheel chair and took me to a room where they monitored my heart rate and blood pressure. I assumed that the stress of this new and somewhat threatening situation would elevate my blood pressure.</p>
<p>It dawned on me that this was a good opportunity to practice lowering my blood pressure by using my preferred breathing technique. I couldn’t see the monitor but was pretty sure my starting pressure was elevated.</p>
<p>Eventually a nurse came by and decided it was time to release me. I asked her what the blood pressure reading was at that point.  She answered, “It’s 117/72, but it was high at first. That’s a very good blood pressure”.  I told her that it was typical of my home readings and she replied, “It’s a good blood pressure anywhere”.</p>
<p>There is nothing spectacular about how I handled this. You can do the same thing. Circumstances weren’t ideal, but I used breath control whenever I could fit it in, and the results were very good. You can do it too.</p>

				<p>Breathe. Controlling your breathing really helps you in stressful situations. A time-honored technique , controlled breathing helps you manage stress reactions on the spot. This post introduces you to &#8220;tactical breathing&#8221; also called &#8220;combat breathing.&#8221;. The tool helps firefighters race into burning buildings, police officers face armed resistance and soldiers fight in close combat. Definitely high-stress, high-risk situations.</p>
<p>Breathe. Our day-to-day stress may be less dramatic, but it&#8217;s real, it&#8217;s ours, and the distress can be intense.</p>
<p>David Grossman, a Lieutenant Colonel in the elite U.S. Army Rangers, put tactical breathing on the map in his book, On Combat: The Psychology and Physiology of Deadly Conflict in War and Peace.</p>
<p><strong>How to Do Tactical Breathing</strong></p>
<p>With some practice, you can control your breathing, relax, and manage your distress.<strong> </strong>Here is how to do it.</p>
<p>Breathe from your diaphragm. Your stomach expands, moving out to make room for the air, as you breathe in, and contracts as you breathe out. Tip: Think of your stomach as a balloon filling with air as you breathe in, and emptying smoothly, automatically as you breathe out.</p>
<ul>
<li>Breathe in through your nose to the count of 4.</li>
<li>Hold your breath to the count of 4.</li>
<li>Breathe out through your lips to the count of 4.</li>
<li>Hold your breath to the count of 4.</li>
<li>Repeat until you feel your body and mind relax.</li>
</ul>
<p>Feel free to vary this tactical  breathing technique. For example, I often breathe in to the count of 4 and out to the count of 7. Important: with my particular approach you do not hold your breath after either exhaling or inhaling. The goal is a smooth, continuous cycle of breathing.</p>
<p>You can adjust either of these methods to discover what feels right to you.</p>
<p>More tips</p>
<p>Simply breathing out is linked to relaxation, and extending that breathing phase is very relaxing. Tip: Bump up the impact by mentally saying &#8220;reeeelaaaax&#8221; as you breathe out.</p>
<p>You can use breath control without practice, but you&#8217;ll be happier with the results if you train ahead of time.</p>
<p>Bonus: No one has to know you are using tactical breathing! You can use this technique inconspicuously in the middle of a distressing situation.</p>
<p>Use controlled breathing:</p>
<ul>
<li>To help prepare for a stressful situation.</li>
<li>While you are actively dealing with stress.</li>
<li>Afterwards, to return to a more relaxed state.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now breathe!</p>

				<p>There’s more than one way to focus.  When you learn <a href="http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Eugene_Gendlin">Eugene Gendlin’s</a> Focusing techniques you gain a new way to experience distress and, in the process, relieve it, in a big way.</p>
<h2>Gendlin’s Focusing</h2>
<p>Ordinary focusing is a matter of blocking out “distractions,” which makes things sharp and crisp. We think of ordinary focusing as shutting out distractions. We may physically tense up as we try to hunker down and focus in. Gendlin’s Focusing technique is different. Gendlin’s Focusing:</p>
<ul>
<li> Relies very heavily on feelings and sensations in your body.</li>
<li> Involves calm, accepting attention to what you are experiencing in your body.</li>
<li> Invites a respectful inquiry from the thinking part of your brain about what is going on in the sensing and feeling parts.</li>
<li> Asks your body what the experiences are about.</li>
<li> Requires patient waiting for answers to come to mind.</li>
<li> Assesses the accuracy of the words that come to mind, not with more thoughts, but with shifts in your bodily sense.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Experience Gendlin’s Focusing Technique</h2>
<p>Mastering Gendlin’s Focusing Technique takes a little practice, but the experience of mastering your distress is rewarding. Learn Gendlin’s Focusing Technique, by reading our post <a href="/2011/05/03/focusing-a-highly-effective-way-to-resolve-distress/" target="_self">Focusing: A Highly Effective Way to Resolve Distress.</a></p>
