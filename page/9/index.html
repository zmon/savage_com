				<p>Someone wrote to us and asked, “what about those of us who have to struggle just to live a normal life?” Recently, Debbie and I discussed this question at length. Have we given the impression that we are only addressing people who want to go from good to great? Neither of us intended anything like that.</p>
<p>Improving resilience is valuable for people who are trying to go from good to great, but also for those who are struggling to barely stay above water. Neither your starting point nor how high you are aiming will exclude you from benefits of learning effective strategies to enhance your resilience.</p>

				<p>In this post we provide some guidance on how to deal with your inner critic. Being self-critical rather than being compassionate toward yourself is the second greatest component of resilience. Yet most people suffer from the persistent though often questionable claims of their “inner critic”.</p>
<p>This <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QE1vnHfOcnU" target="_self">video</a> exposes the inner critic at work.</p>
<p>When I first heard the criticisms in this animation, I was almost overwhelmed by them. It took a while for me to see how to fight back against them. It is one thing to hear the words, but the emotional tone greatly intensifies their power.</p>
<p>Lest you think this is an unrealistic portrayal of self-criticism, here are things Major League pitchers used to describe themselves: “idiot,” “loser,” “dummy,” “gutless,” and “I stink,” “I can’t,” “I don’t have it,” and “I’m clueless.” Keep in mind that major league pitchers are a VERY highly selected for their outstanding talent and performance.</p>
<p>Obviously, it is demoralizing to have statements like these hurled at you, even though you are the person who hurls them.</p>
<p>The legendary Rabbi Hillel said “”If I am not for myself, who will be for me? And if I am only for myself, what am I? And if not now, when?”</p>
<p>Almost anyone can see this is wisdom in its clearest form. Yet, so many of us are not “for ourselves”.</p>
<p>What can we do about this?</p>

				<p>Studies of holocaust survivors indicate that<em> how we react</em> is, even in extreme circumstances, crucial in determining how much damage is done. Though we have little or no control over outside circumstances, we can still influence our inner reactions to them.</p>
<p>Today, many people face exceptionally harsh conditions, and they are unaccustomed to the levels of stress they have to endure. It is hard for them to believe there is anything they can do to make things better. The problem is outside of them and beyond their control. How they react to their circumstances may seem irrelevant.</p>
<p>But research on holocaust survivors indicates that how one reacts even in the most heinous situations has a powerful effect on survival and well-being.</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salutogenesis" target="_self">Aaron Antonovsky </a>studied survivors of the camps, and concluded that, though they were largely helpless on the outside, their inner attitudes could make a great difference. Prior to that work, Victor Frankl, a survivor of the camps, had written about his own views on this topic from an inside perspective. He and Antonovsky came to very similar conclusions about which ways of reacting were best.</p>

				<div class="entry-content">
				<p>I think it is safe to say that a large majority of us gravely underestimate the powers of our minds and overestimate the powers of medicine. Whether your problem is sleeplessness, pain or some other potentially overwhelming challenge, your mind, especially if you train and develop its powers, can work wonders in corralling and controlling your problem.</p>
<p>Fortunately the title of this post implies a false dichotomy. Why not meditate AND medicate? Why not do what you can to control your problem by training your mind and then minimize the use of medical interventions.</p>
<p>Why should you take the trouble to train your mind? Well, the human body is a complex ecosystem. Every attempt to control such a system by tampering with its inner workings triggers an avalanche of unpredictable results. Our body’s complexity makes it subject to what has been called “<a href="http://www.imho.com/grae/chaos/chaos.html">the butterfly effect</a>”.  The butterfly effect refers to the fact that the tiny effect of a butterfly flapping its wings in China may change the weather in, say, Los Angeles. (Click the link above for a more detailed explanation.)</p>
<p>This effect implies that complex systems can be heavily influenced by tiny variations in factors that scientists would usually see as negligible. The butterfly effect clarifies why all medicines have “side effects”, and also why It is wise to minimize the risks of putting alien substances into our bodies.</p>
<p>In light of this, I had a strong reaction to a recent article in the New York Times <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/06/fashion/mothers-and-sleep-medication.html?_r=2&amp;src=rechp">referring to sleep medications as “mother’s little helper”.</a></p>
<p>There are useful non-medical ways to deal with sleeplessness and they can powerfully improve the effects of medical treatment while minimizing the risks entailed in taking medication. For example most of the sleepless mothers described in the New York Times article could not sleep because they were obsessively ruminating over tasks that needed to be done.</p>
<p>Meditation can help reduce such rumination. While meditating you deal with mental distractions by gently and compassionately returning your mind to the object on which you are meditating.</p>
<p>Think of it in terms of deeply ingrained stimulus-response bonds; the thought is the stimulus and it demands that you respond. One illustrative example from the Times article is a mother who said “There’s always the worry another e-mail has come in” (stimulus). &#8220;It’s hard to resist getting up and checking your emai&#8221;l (response).</p>
<p>But when you meditate, you learn over and over not to do things like taking that last peek; instead you train your mind to go back to your chosen object of meditation. This breaks the stimulus-response bond. Think of it, there are probably thousands of thoughts that create in you an urge to take action, but your meditation breaks the bond between thought and action.  It reduces the linkage to the point where the response becomes optional instead of compulsive. That will make you calmer.</p>
<p>Earlier we posted <a href="/2011/03/02/basic-mindfulness-technique/">a traditional way of doing mindfulness meditation</a>, and also an <a href="/2010/12/06/a-key-step-in-resilience-training-is-learning-deep-relaxation/">audio</a> that can have a similar effect. Nether of these aids take up much of your time. You should consider trying one or both of them.</p>
<p>This is only one small way of changing how your mind works. We will be discussing many more in later posts.</p>

				<div class="entry-content">
				<p>In this post we want to introduce you to Dr. Chris Johnstone, a British Medical Doctor whose approach to resilience training is very similar to our own. We see him as a remarkably kindred spirit.</p>
<p>There are four videos in the collection from the Bristol Happiness Lectures, 2010. We urge you to watch them all. Since many of you will not have time for that, at least take a look at <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnsBWJm7Ckc">this one</a>, the second in the series, which is about 8 minutes long.</p>
<p>Some important ideas from Dr. Johnstone:</p>
<ol>
<li>Resilience training can be      as effective in dealing with depression as widely used medications for      depression (SSRIs).</li>
<li>In one study, school      children at risk for depression who were given resilience training reduced      symptoms of depression, as measured two years later, by 50%.</li>
<li>Attributing your lack of      resilience to your DNA does you no good because you cannot change your      DNA.</li>
<li>To learn and apply new      ways of dealing with difficult situations may seem overwhelming, but small      changes can add up and have disproportionate results.</li>
<li>Pessimism is a risk factor      for depression like smoking is a risk factor for lung cancer.  (An important aspect of resilience      training is learning to be more optimistic.)</li>
<li>Taking a problem-solving approach      to difficult situations can reduce minor to moderate symptoms of depression. Having a problem-solving attitude is closely      linked with optimism.</li>
<li>Both training      yourself to be more optimistic, and exercising can reduce depression</li>
</ol>
<p>Those of you have read a number of our posts will recognize some of these ideas as identical to our own, so you can understand why we were delighted to discover Dr. Johnstone.</p>
<p>Finally, how can you learn to increase your resilience? You can go a long way just by reading our posts, and making a serious effort to practice the various techniques we describe. In addition, Dr. Johnstone has a very useful book called &#8220;Finding Your Power&#8221;, which you can get <a href="http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss?url=search-alias%3Dstripbooks&amp;field-keywords=Chris+Johnstone&amp;x=17&amp;y=21">here</a>.</p>

				<p>If you don’t do anything else with this post, click <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RP4abiHdQpc">here</a> to see a video of a laughing baby. See what reactions you have to it.</p>
<p>Many people use alcohol as their preferred way to relieve distress. I recently read somewhere that 61 % of those surveyed preferred alcohol after a hard day. When I googled it to find a reference, I found a survey done in Bermuda that got that result. The very first comment was in essence “Ho Hum, everybody knows that people in Bermuda drink a lot.” So maybe that 61% isn’t typical, but it’s pretty clear that alcohol is widely used to relieve stress.</p>
<p>Once Debbie was asked to speak to librarians about how to deal with their stress. Librarians have experienced increased stress because of the challenges created by new information technologies.</p>
<p>We searched the literature on the librarians’ ways of controlling their stress reactions, and found a survey with “drinking whiskey” around the top of the list. Maybe being on top didn’t mean being most common, but at least it was a presence.</p>
<p>A very close friend of mine was on a committee to find ways to control alcohol use in young people. The Director of his organization sat in on one of their meetings for a while. When the director left he wished the committee good luck but said “The trouble is, that stuff really works”. He had something there, but it was not the whole story.</p>
<p>Actually, alcohol is not a very good resilience device. It has its place, and is, so far as we know, even healthy if used in moderation. It tends to numb awareness of stress responses, but has secondary stimulant effects. So people who rely on it to relax often do not sleep well, or wake up the next morning feeling tense and irritable.</p>
<p>What is striking about alcohol is that it can <strong><em>quickly</em></strong> move people from a stressed state to a more relaxed, or even a euphoric state.</p>
<p>I am very wary of this “better living through chemistry” approach to life’s problems. So for years I have pondered how to match that speediness of the effects of alcohol with something that does not have the drawbacks of the drug.</p>
<p>Many of our training techniques do pretty well at that. For example, <a href="/2011/06/02/tactical-breathing-can-stop-stress-on-the-spot/">combat/tactical breathing</a> has a calming effect in situations where swigging some whiskey or having a martini are not viable options. And the effects are prompt.</p>
<p>Combat breathing neutralizes stress responses, but may not induce positive feelings.</p>
<p>For that, “<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emotional_contagion">psychological contagion</a>” can be useful. Psychological reactions tend to spread from one person to another, just as contagious diseases do. If you haven’t looked at the laughing baby video, do it now. It’s likely to be contagious. If you are stressed, it will probably change your mood <strong><em>quickly</em></strong>.</p>

				<p>This post is about an online speech that touches on many aspects of resilience, and it is not easy to reconcile with our view of resilience. Originally our work was on vulnerability, but eventually we shifted to what we saw as its polar opposite, resilience. The idea was that vulnerable people react to demands and challenges in ways that make them unable to function effectively. They fall apart in the face of stress, sometimes even minor stress. Resilient people react in ways that enable them to function well and move on to success in life in spite of stress, and to deal even with major stress in ways that allow them to achieve what they value in life.</p>
<p>The view taken by Brene Brown is that vulnerability is the key to living “whole heartedly”. Dr. Brown makes an excellent case for her point of view, and later we will explain why our view and hers are actually compatible. But for now, we urge you to sit back and listen to what she has to say. It is about 20 minutes long, but worth far more than most of things we usually spend 20 minutes doing.</p>

				<ol>
<li>Don’t make the mistake of      thinking you can bypass the grieving process by jumping into another      relationship right away. You are betting against the odds if you do this.</li>
<li>If you are overwhelmed by      the pain of separation, betrayal, etc., try dealing with the pain and      distress by using intense exercise suitable to your level of health and      fitness. Check with your doctor about this, since you probably are not in      a good place to evaluate what your body can safely do for you.</li>
<li> Use <a href="/page/2011/06/02/tactical-breathing-can-stop-stress-on-the-spot/">tactical/combat      breathing</a> to get through painful surges of distress.</li>
<li>Listen to <a href="/page/2010/12/06/a-key-step-in-resilience-training-is-learning-deep-relaxation/?#more-448">relaxation      audios</a>. They can give you relief when you are down.</li>
<li>You may be too stressed to      do this, but, if you can, try <a href="/page/2011/05/03/focusing-a-highly-effective-way-to-resolve-distress/">focusing</a>.      It is the best way to get to the bottom of what is making this so hard for      you and what set you up for it. Focusing will help you to understand why      it’s so painful, and to see it in a clearer light. We have explained how      to do focusing earlier in this blog. It isn’t easy, but also is not very      hard to do.</li>
<li>Watch out! Be careful      about making major life decisions before you have worked through the loss.      Decisions you make after experiencing a loss, whether a rejection, or a      mutually agreed upon split, cannot be trusted. You are in pain and please      don’t make decisions that will later produce more pain.</li>
<li>Look for guidance by      trusted others. Don’t choose others who are bitter over their own lost      relationships. Choose those who have demonstrated the ability to form      stable relationships.</li>
<li>This is a good time to put      some <strong><em>serious effort</em></strong> into psychotherapy. By “serious effort” we      mean you go into therapy with the idea that it is your opportunity to      review whether your relationships are distorted by old realities from your      past. As Freud wisely said “Our patients suffer from reminiscences and      neglect present reality in their favor”. Therapists aren’t embedded in the      web that you are trying to exit, and you need this outsider’s viewpoint.</li>
<li>Don’t fall for any      explanation that is something like “Why did this happen? Because I am      crap! “. That’s someone else’s story, and of no use to you at all.</li>
<li>This is a hard one, but      once you move your focus from how terrible and unfair your former partner      has been to how you are going to shift to a new and better life, the      better off you will be.<em> </em>
