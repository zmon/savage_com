				<div class="entry-content">
				<p>Last year we conducted a resilience training program for women and it was a great experience for us. Focusing on issues of particular interest to women was an eye-opener, even when we were getting most of the information from our own book manuscript. Once we were focused on women in particular, it became clear that a surprising amount of the research we discussed in our book was about women. Here we list many of those, and some others that are important to both women and men.</p>
<p>We came to the conclusion that women in particular need to build their resilience and thus neutralize the effects of stress. Here are some reasons why we think that:</p>
<ul>
<li>In an important study, women who hid their thoughts and feelings (“Self-Silenced”) during marital conflict were four times as <a href="http://uk.reuters.com/article/idUKKIM05985320070820">likely to die</a> during the ten year study as women who spoke up. Men did not show the same effect. Resilience training includes learning the skills needed to express yourself without causing unnecessary trouble.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Highly stressed women have chromosomes that reflect over a <em>decade</em> of extra aging when compared to those of women who are low in stress. (For more on this click <a href="http://www.pnas.org/cgi/reprint/101/49/17312">here</a>).</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The most damaging pattern of stress is when your stress hormones go up and stay up for a long time. With resilience these hormones may go up but recovery is prompt. Research done in Sweden by <a href="http://www.abebooks.com/servlet/BookDetailsPL?bi=4085112582&amp;searchurl=an%3Dhans%2Bselye%26sts%3Dt%26x%3D33%26y%3D9">Marianne Frankenhaeuser</a> shows that working women as well as working men have high stress hormone levels during the workday, but for men these levels drop after work. For women they are less likely to do so, especially if they have children. If they can’t arrange for a more equitable sharing of work at home, women need to learn skills that bring those levels down in the evening.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Researchers found that couples with high levels of stress hormones in the first year of their marriages were 30% more likely to be <a href="http://www.psych.ndsu.nodak.edu/hilmert/Classes/Psyc787/Week%207/K_Glaser_2003.pdf">divorced 10 years later</a>. Those high in stress who were still married were twice as likely to have troubled marriages.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Women with high levels of stress hormones are three times more likely to have <a href="http://www.webmd.com/baby/news/20060221/stress-may-up-early-miscarriage-risk">miscarriages</a>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>In one study, women with high levels of stress hormones had significantly lower bone density in the back and thigh. For more details click <a href="http://www.journals.elsevierhealth.com/periodicals/bps/article/S0006-3223%2804%2901376-9/abstract">here</a>.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>When stressed, both men and women are less able to think clearly, are more forgetful, and more likely to miss information important for them to do well in life and deal effectively with others. For an extensive review of stress and cognition <a href="http://human-factors.arc.nasa.gov/flightcognition/Publications/IH_054_Staal.pdf">click here</a>.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Stress hormones <a href="http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2000/11/001120072314.htm" target="_self">increase abdominal fat</a>, especially internal fat. High levels of internal abdominal fat are associated with cardiovascular disease in both men and women.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>People who have to be caregivers of elders with dementia (disproportionately women) tend to have suppressed immunity, and it stays suppressed for years after the loved one dies. Biological indicators of age indicated that the caregivers’ on average lost four to eight years of their <a href="http://researchnews.osu.edu/archive/telomeres.htm">lifespan</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is far from a complete list. Still we think it makes a compelling case for women to devote some of their energy to becoming as resilient as they can be.</p>

				<p>Slowly and painfully I have become aware that the term “resilience” seldom rings anybody’s chime. In this post I want to dig beneath the surface to show what improved resilience might mean to you.</p>
<p>Some people are dealt a poor hand in life from the start of their lives. Some of those play the hand well, and others succumb to its limitations.</p>
<p>Most of us are dealt a poor hand from time to time, maybe even frequently. But it’s not the hand we are dealt that determines our happiness, success, or health. How well we play the hand is of central importance.</p>
<p>Learning to be more resilient teaches you how to get the most out of life even when it deals you one of these poor hands. But is also teaches you how to get more out of life even when the hand you are dealt is not particularly bad. This encompasses most of life’s activities.</p>
<p>I started out studying the relationship between stress and physical<em> </em>health. When I began looking into this topic, the evidence in favor of it was fairly primitive. Many studies had shown that illness tends to be preceded by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holmes_and_Rahe_stress_scale">periods of high stress</a>. Since then, over and over, studies have confirmed the <a href="http://whyfiles.org/039emotion/cohen.html">relationship between stress and health</a>. Now we have a large body of research supporting the idea that stress is related to many diseases from the common cold to <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2979339/?tool=pmcentrez">serious heart disease</a>.</p>
<p>Many found this relationship between mind and physical health hard to believe. We had no solid understanding of how a mental reaction could produce physical illness, so the relationship seemed beyond the pale of science.</p>
<p>Now we also have research showing a <a href="http://www.springerlink.com/content/qp61nj5v64445015/">powerful impact of stress on the body’s immune and endocrine systems</a>. For example, we now know that <a href="http://pni.osumc.edu/KG%20Publications%20%28pdf%29/102.pdf">stress influences the speed of wound healing</a>, and we also know a great deal about the <a href="http://pni.osumc.edu/KG%20Publications%20%28pdf%29/132.pdf">processes in the immune system that underlie the swifter healing</a>. Further, we know <a href="http://pni.osumc.edu/KG%20Publications%20%28pdf%29/065.pdf">that practicing deep relaxation <em>enhances</em> the ability of the body to heal</a>. Learning to relax deeply is a central aspect of learning to be more resilient.</p>
<p>Research on resilience has also revealed that it influences many other aspects of life and that it can compel you forward even if you haven’t been dealt a bad hand. For example, greater resilience has been linked to <a href="http://www.mindresources.net/marketing/website/profilingtools/MetLifeCaseStudyMRSSS.pdf">better performance of salespeople</a>, <a href="http://repository.upenn.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1003&amp;context=mapp_capstone">business managers</a>, and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Learned-Optimism-Change-Your-Mind/dp/0671019112">athletes</a>. It has also been linked to more <a href="http://pni.osumc.edu/KG%20Press%20Releases/OSU%20researchers%20identify%20predictors%20of%20divorce.htm">successful relationships</a>. And we could go on and on with examples from just about any facet of life.</p>

				<p>The title of this post (in Latin) is cut in stone on the entryway to the gym at the University where I spent the great bulk of my working life. Nietzsche said something very similar, “Whatever does not kill me makes me stronger”. Statements like these are much contested on the Internet; taken too literally they are dubious at best.  However, I think we should lighten up and understand they are part poetry and part wisdom.</p>
<p>The quotations point toward an important question. <em>Can going through adversity actually improve your ability to pull through distressing experiences?</em> The New York Times recently published an <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/04/health/04mind.html">article</a> describing research on close to 2000 people who were asked to indicate all of the upsetting life events they had experienced before entering the study and any new ones that occurred along the way. Examples of such events included divorce, the death of a friend or parent, a serious illness, and being in a natural disaster.</p>
<p>The mental well-being of the participants was monitored over several years. The mental well-being measures were compared for those who reported no such life events, those who reported 2 to 6 such events, and those who presented 7 or more.</p>
<p>Those who reported no events were not highest in mental well-being. In fact, their well-being was like that of participants who reported 12 or more adverse events. Intermediate levels of adversity were associated with the greatest well-being.</p>
<p>The NYT article goes on to make two points: 1. We cannot accurately predict who will emerge from adversity well or even stronger and 2. It may be that dealing with adversity is important because it provides opportunities to hone skills for dealing with challenging situations.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the first point is not quite accurate and the second, though sensible, is mere speculation. The main thrust of this post is to object to the first point.</p>
<p>For a long time we could only speculate about which qualities enabled some people to go through hellish challenges and come out of them healthy, happy, and successful. But there is now a well-developed science of resilience.</p>
<p>I will briefly discuss two examples, but there are many:</p>

				<div class="entry-content">
				<p>It’s not uncommon for colleagues to express doubt that we can actually influence people to do the work involved in improving their resilience. They opine that people will not be willing to work that hard.</p>
<p>In an earlier post we pointed out that internalizing a resilient approach to life, which does take serious effort, is not essential to increasing resilience. In that post we explained how “props” can augment your functioning, enabling you to respond in a more resilient way than you could on your own. Props can be as simple as listening to a relaxation audio when you feel the need.</p>
<p>Also, in another earlier post, we listed many easy, pleasant ways you can sooth yourself and get relief from distress using ways that are already familiar to you, for example, cuddling with a pet or lover, listening to music, or getting a massage. Not exactly hard work.</p>
<p>In this post we will cover another factor that makes building resilience easier- the importance of small changes. No one has done a better job of explaining that importance than Larry and Susan Terkel, in their book, “<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Small-Change-Little-Things-Difference/dp/1585423599">Small Change* It’s the Little Things in Life That Make a <strong>BIG</strong> Difference</a>!” Here are some important quotes from that book:</p>
<ul>
<li>“Small change adds up.      This is worth repeating: small change adds up. Empty your small change in      a jar every day, and watch the total add up over time. Make small changes      in your daily habits &#8211; such as your meals or snacks, your relationships,      your work, or your leisure- and watch those changes gradually accumulate      into a much healthier, happier, and more satisfying life.”</li>
<li>“An angle of only one      degree is difficult to draw on a piece of paper. It is too small. If a      flight from New York to Los Angeles is off course by just one degree, the      plane will arrive closer to Tijuana, Mexico, than Los Angeles.”</li>
<li>“Small changes can get us      back on course as easily as the can lead us off course.”</li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally, at the very beginning of working toward improvement, small changes in effort produce disproportionately large results.  For example, if you have long been sedentary and you begin a modest program of walking several times a week, your fitness will improve much more dramatically than it would if you were starting from a high level of fitness. A Silver Medal winning athlete who is determined to go for the gold will have to expend huge effort to make the needed changes.</p>
<p>This pattern of big, easy change in the beginning and smaller, effortful change at the end is so common that is has been applied in many different scientific fields and is known as The Growth Curve.</p>
<p>In helping people to improve their resilience, we always suggest that they try from one to, at most, three changes at any one time. It’s just fine if the changes you choose to try are small ones.</p>

				<p>Underlying our posts is research we have done on the core factors that produce resilience. There is a potpourri of things that have been identified in published articles as being important to resilience. Our research was designed to find out whether many of these things were functionally the same things, but under different names.</p>
<p>Our results, after extensive research, showed that there were three core factors that determine resilience. These core factors have been an underlying influence on our posts so far, and on our approach to teaching people how to be more resilient.</p>
<p>The factors are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Having skills that enable      you to sooth and relax yourself and attitudes that are positive.</li>
<li>Being temperate, kind and      self-supportive in the ways you evaluate yourself and your achievements.</li>
<li>Taking the time and effort      to understand your reactions to distress and to express them in ways that      are helpful to you, without alienating others.</li>
</ol>
<p>So far we have talked, in various ways, about the first factor, resilience-promoting skills and attitudes. Things like arranging for contact comfort and soothing sensory stimulation are resilience skills.  Having positive attitudes (we have so far focused on optimism) also helps you be more resilient.</p>
<p>The second factor has to do with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0071608826?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=positivecom0b-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0071608826">how you evaluate yourself and how reasonable you are with the demands you make on yourself</a>. Being <a href="http://positivepsychologynews.com/news/eleanor-chin/200909154085">too self-critical or perfectionistic</a> will make you more vulnerable, and thus less able to limit distress. If you do not learn how to limit that impact you may well amplify it, as so many people do.</p>
<p>The third factor is knowing (or learning how) to pay careful attention to how you really feel about things that are stressful for you, and <a href="http://homepage.psy.utexas.edu/homepage/Faculty/Pennebaker/Home2000/WritingandHealth.html">finding a way to express your feelings</a> as fully as possible without alienating other people.</p>
<p>Resilient people do better than can reasonably be expected in difficult situations. They also tend to be more successful, happier, more effective, and healthy. For a long time this exceeding of reasonable expectations was taken as the very definition of resilience.  Our work has been about what actions underlie such remarkable performance. What do people labeled as resilient actually <strong><em>do</em></strong> that is different from those who are vulnerable and tend to collapse even in the face of relatively minor challenges.</p>
<p>The great value of focusing on what resilient people <strong><em>do</em></strong>, is that it becomes very clear that less resilient people can be <em>taught</em> to do these helpful things. They just need to know what to do and to be guided to practice the skills and build the habits that make the needed changes.</p>
<p>The hope is that those who tend to collapse under stress, many of whom have been very close to my heart, can learn some basic “secrets” of those who take stress in their stride, the naturally resilient .</p>

				<div class="entry-content">
				<p>I always have to laugh when I see authors advise their readers to “be optimistic”. You are not likely to be successful at turning pessimism off or optimism on just by an act of will. You have to take a strategic path. Usually you have to retrain yourself so you can replace old habits with more useful, new ones. You need reliable techniques and you need to practice them.</p>
<p>For this post I want to explain three techniques for shifting away from pessimism.</p>
<p>In short:</p>
<ol>
<li>Each day, think of three      things that went well.</li>
<li>If you catch yourself      being self-critical, examine the criticism and defend yourself against it.</li>
<li>If things go badly, avoid      explanations that focus on unchangeable causes. Instead look for causes      that can be modified.</li>
</ol>
<p>In more detail:</p>
<p>Here are some things that have scientific support, and that we have found to be helpful.</p>
<ol>
<li>We first learned about the following simple method from a TV interview with <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwkDEM4gFBA">Martin Seligman</a>, the founder of “positive psychology. Now it is all over the internet.
<ul>
<li>At the end of each day,      think of three things that worked out well for you that day. It is best to      do this just before you go to sleep. We would recommend that you write them      down, since that is likely to intensify the attention you give them.</li>
<li>The method is that simple.      And Seligman pointed out in the interview that, after six months of doing      this, people were happier and more optimistic.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li> A second approach to moving from pessimism to optimism is to monitor how you talk to yourself. Watch what you say to yourself, and if it is not optimistic and self-supportive, submit it to critical analysis.Ask yourself these questions:
<ul>
<li>Are these statements needlessly discouraging?</li>
<li>Where did they come from? Are they based on solid evidence or did you just hear them as you were growing up?</li>
<li>What evidence is there to support them?</li>
<li>Is the evidence compelling? If you were on a jury would you see it as convincing?</li>
<li>Is this way of thinking useful to you? <em>You do not have to collude in tearing yourself down</em>.</li>
<li>Is it self-supportive? Of what value are your self-statements if they do nothing to help you?</li>
</ul>
<p>If your self-talk flunks these tests, the talk is probably old baggage, not worthy of you. There are always many alternative ways to view a situation. Look for other interpretations  that are more helpful and encouraging.</p>
</li>
<li> A third approach is to pay attention to your “explanatory style”. How do you explain, to yourself and to others, why your efforts did not pay off? There are many things to be said about how you explain why something has not come out well. Martin Seligman sees explanatory style as a central issue in positivity. We want to focus here on one facet that seems particularly important: Does this explanation meet the following standards?
<ul>
<li>Does it direct your attention to characteristics of you or the situation that can’t be changed? If so, it is likely to stop you from succeeding. If a student flunks a test and explains it by concluding that he or she is stupid, that’s not changeable. On the other hand if the explanation is that the student needs to develop better note-taking skills or study habits, or to go to the teacher to ask for advice, or study more, there is a good chance for improvement.</li>
<li>Does this explanation encourage you to review what is going on in detail and look for solutions? That is the path to improvement.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>If your explanation doesn’t meet these criteria, it should be presumed to be doubtful, and treated as propaganda from sources that aren’t or weren’t strongly interested in your being the best you can be.</p>

				<p>Some people seem to be just naturally optimistic. I have been lucky to have some close friends who are like that. Optimism seems to be a natural part of their personalities. I have learned from them.</p>
<p>My own family tended to be what President Reagan used to call “doomers and gloomers”.  But that was only a tendency. We were always inclined to believe that our efforts could change things for the better. Like us, most people are a mix of optimist and pessimist.</p>
<p>My experience and my reading of the scientific research on optimism versus pessimism has convinced me that <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Positivity-Groundbreaking-Research-Strength-Negativity/dp/0307393739">it is a good idea for most of us to be less pessimistic and more optimistic</a>. Especially to be less pessimistic, but more optimistic is good too. It’s really more than a good idea; it can have a major impact on your happiness, health, and success.</p>
<p>The important question is how do we change in the direction of optimism?</p>
<p>There is a lot of published research on this, and it is encouraging. Here is our take on the most promising ways to become less pessimistic and more optimistic.</p>
<ul>
<li>Direct your attention to things that have gone well for you.</li>
<li>When you interpret things in ways that discourage you, seriously consider other, more positive ways to interpret what happened.</li>
<li>When pessimistic thoughts come to mind, view them with suspicion and strongly challenge them.</li>
<li>When your efforts produce bad results, be wary if you attribute the results to causes that are very difficult or even impossible to change.</li>
</ul>
<p>Changing these aspects of how you deploy your mind is not easy. The way you do it now is probably based on powerful motivations and long experience. So we have to consider <em>how</em> to change mental patterns that are deeply ingrained. We will do that in our next post.</p>

<p><em>Optimism is about looking at reality and attending more to a positive interpretation of it than to a negative one.

<p><em>*****************************************</em></p>
<p>I am a longstanding  <a href="http://www.barbaraehrenreich.com/">Barbara Ehrenreich</a> fan. So when I learned that she had written a book blaming positive thinking for undermining America, I was taken aback. I had just finished co-authoring a book that included a section on the positive impact of optimism. Research strongly affirms the benefits of optimism for such things as health, performance, and success. Of course the term “positive thinking” is very loosely defined, but presumably optimism would be somewhere near its core meaning.</p>
<p>Fortunately I had two background experiences that helped me understand why someone would be cynical about the impact of optimism. My reading on the topic included works about the impact of optimism on business performance. There too, I encountered a very pessimistic view of optimism. There was even a paper critical of optimism co-authored by Nobel Prize winner, <a href="http://hbswk.hbs.edu/archive/3630.html">Daniel Kahneman</a>, whose work I have followed with admiration for decades.</p>
<p>Looking at the arguments closely, I found that the business writers were using the word “optimism” as an equivalent of what psychologists call “denial”. A business person failing to include some significant aspect of reality that is relevant to his or her business decisions is in denial. These critical accounts of optimism refer to such things as failing to take into account the downside risks of business decisions. But that is not what I or many other people are talking about when we refer to optimism.</p>
<p>Optimism is about<em> looking at reality</em> and attending more to a positive interpretation of it than to a negative one. Thinking that “The glass is half full” rather than “The glass is half empty” is almost a paradigm of optimism. The true state of the glass is not in dispute. Anyone who looks at it can see where the waterline is.

<h3><em>Highlights:</em></h3>
<p><em>Resilient actions and resilient attitudes are centrally important to becoming more resilient.</em></p>
<p><em>In this post we want to call your attention to the value of optimism.</em></p>
<p><em>Research on the influence of optimism and pessimism has tended to be focused on three things:</em></p>

<p><em>***************************************************************************</em></p>
<p>A major way to improve your resilience is to learn the kinds of self-soothing skills we have been discussing, and turning them into habits. Developing habits of self-soothing in distressing situations and of relaxing deeply to replenish yourself are pivotal to improving resilience.</p>
<p>Equally important is shifting how you think, your attitudes. Positive attitudes improve resilience.</p>
<h3>More resilient people:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Are optimistic, consider interpretations of life events that are positive.</li>
<li>See problems as solvable.</li>
<li>See their lives as making sense, as meaningful.</li>
<li>Feel that they have valuable connections to others.</li>

<p><em>When the exercise came to an end, I realized that it had produced far more than merely “taking the edge off the anxiety”. I was downright serene. Somehow, my entire perspective had shifted.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">**********************************************************</p>
<p>We strongly advocate devoting a good deal of time and energy to building your resilience, so you may be surprised to learn that we also believe that:</p>
<ul>
<li>You can <em>improve</em> it with very little effort. You can make significant improvements in your resilience by practicing a few minutes per day.</li>
<li>You can even use resilience-enhancing “prosthetic procedures” or “props” that require little or no practice, though their usefulness gets greater with use.</li>
</ul>
<p>Props function in a way that is similar to the way eyeglasses or canes do. Virtually anyone can use them, and they help you function better even without changing any limitations you may have.</p>
<p>The recording we linked to the previous post is a good example of a resilience prop. It can be helpful whether you are highly resilient at your core or not.</p>
<p>An experience Jerry had illustrates the power of these recordings:</p>
<p>&#8220;I was a full time professor for several decades. Contrary to a prevalent illusion, the days when academe provided a nice, relaxing job are long gone. I loved many aspects of my work, but in too many ways it was a “rat race”. I had started grammar school a year early, finished undergraduate school in less than four years, working nights the whole time, finished my doctoral program very quickly and then, after I became a professor, almost always had an extra job. My nickname in my Department was &#8216;The Busy Professor&#8217;.</p>
<p>I always had a dream of getting out of the rat race early just as I had started early. Our university began giving early retirement incentives, but I was not old enough to be eligible. Luckily another incentive was provided just as I reached an age that allowed me to grab it. I actually succeeded in getting out early!</p>
<p>Then, a month or two after my retirement, my bowels started producing copious amounts of blood.</p>
<p>I catastrophized. Just when I thought I was home safe, it appeared it all might well be taken away from me. I became intensely anxious and, even though I had worked in the areas of stress and resilience for many years, I was taken over by this anxiety.</p>
